You can meet them on our team page. We continually take steps to protect your information against loss, misuse, unauthorized access, unauthorized disclosure, manipulation, or destruction. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAs a basic principle, the Swiss Federal Data Protection Act (FADP) applies to the processing of your personal data. In certain circumstances, for example if you access our offers from a Member State of the European Union, the European Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR) may also apply. If you access our services from the State of California, USA, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) may also apply.\nDoodle AG participates in the [IAB Transparency and Consent Framework 2.0](https://iabeurope.eu/tcf-2-0/) (IAB TCF 2.0 or Framework), an industry standard that allows all participants in the digital advertising market (publishers, advertisers, technology service providers, etc.) to transparently inform end users about the processing of your personal data and to give you the opportunity to agree or disagree with it. As a participant in the IAB TCF 2.0, Doodle AG adheres to the technical and legal (guidelines) requirements of the framework and offers you, the end user, the opportunity to manage your privacy settings via a Consent Management Platform (CMP). Doodle AG uses the CMP solutions from OneTrust (Web; CMP ID # 28) and TX Group AG (Mobile Native; CMP ID # 359). ",

Through Day One\u2019s App and Site, we offer you a journaling program to record your memories, and, if you wish, share them with others as well. Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.\nThroughout this Privacy Policy we\u2019ll refer to Day One\u2019s Sites, Apps, and other services collectively as \u201cServices.\u201d This Privacy Policy only applies to the Day One Services and not to other services provided by Automattic.\n",

Here are some examples:\n* **Your Journal Entries:** The most important thing we collect from you are your journal entries. Your journal entries are private. This means that when you use Day One to create a journal, none of the entries in that journal are made publicly viewable on the Internet. Entries are not accessible to other Day One users. We also offer [End to End Encryption](https://dayoneapp.com/guides/day-one-sync/end-to-end-encryption-faq/) on our journals. If that option is enabled, it is _impossible_ for our employees to access your journal data.\n* **Account Information:** If you register and open an \u201cAccount\u201d with us in order to use services like Sync and Backups, you provide us basic account information including your email address and a password.\n* **Transactional Information:** When you purchase Services, we may collect information to complete and record the transaction. For example, if you buy something from us we\u2019ll collect information, like your name and credit card information, to process those payments . If you purchase a printed book we will collect the physical address you want the book mailed to. We also keep a record of the purchases you\u2019ve made.\n* **Communications with Us:** You may also provide us with information when you provide us feedback or communicate with our Happiness Engineers about a support question.

We collect log information when you use our Services \u2014 for example, when you log into your account or publish a journal entry.\n* **Device and Usage Information:** We collect your device type, your wireless carrier, your individual device ID, and how you use our Services. In addition, in the event our App(s) crash on your mobile device, we will receive information about your mobile device model software version and device carrier, which allows us to identify and fix bugs and otherwise improve the performance of our App(s).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n* **Location Information:** We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address. We collect and use this information to understand where our users are located so we can identify what features might be meaningful to them.\n* **Information from Cookies & Other Technologies:** Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information. A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor\u2019s computer, and that the visitor\u2019s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and emails. Automattic uses cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services, as well as track and understand email campaign effectiveness. For example, we use Google Analytics to help analyze how users use the Site. We do not combine the information generated through the use of Google Analytics with your personal information. Google\u2019s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Site is governed by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.\n",

For example, when you connect Day One to your Apple or Google account in order to log in, we may access certain user data such as your name, user ID, email, etc. to provide our Services.\u00a0\n* **Motion, Activity, and Fitness Data:** Motion and fitness information is used to enhance the metadata included in individual entries and personal journal summaries. For example, we use the motion processing capabilities of your device to enable you to add step counts to any journal entry. As another example, if you connect Apple HealthKit then time spent in the Day One app will be logged in HealthKit as Mindful Minutes. We never use your motion, activity, or fitness data for advertising and similar services or for use-based data mining.

This includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you (like payment providers that process your credit and debit card information, cloud storage services, SMS messaging services, book printing services if you choose to print your journal to a book, and customer chat and email support services that help us communicate with you), those that assist us with our marketing efforts (like sending emails to our marketing list), those that help us understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers), those that make tools to help us run our operations (like programs that help us with task management, scheduling, word processing, email and other communications, and collaboration among our teams), and other third-party tools that help us manage operations.

If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy;\n* **Legal, Regulatory, & Other Obligations:** We may disclose information about you if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) resolve disputes, investigate problems, or enforce our Terms of Service; (b) comply with relevant laws, or warrants, subpoenas, court orders, and other enforceable legal process; or (c) protect the property or rights belonging to Day One, you, third parties, or the public at large.

Therefore,within the context of NetSupport DNA, NetSupport is neither the data controller nor the dataprocessor.\nIS THE SCHOOL THE DATA PROCESSOR OR THE DATA CONTROLLER WITHIN THE CONTEXT OFNETSUPPORT SYSTEMS?\nFor users of NetSupport DNA, schools remain the data controller of their own data on the system.\nDOES NETSUPPORT DNA PROCESS PERSONAL DATA?Personal information associated with individual students and staff is processed by NetSupportDNA,therefore the rules of the GDPR apply to its use. This personal data is stored locally on theschool\u2019s servers and therefore the school will remain the data controller and the dataprocessor of this personal information.\nDOES NETSUPPORT DNA PROCESS SENSITIVE DATA?When an eSafety alert is triggered in NetSupport DNA, the system can be configured to recordscreen data and record images from a webcam. Due to the possible nature of this data, it couldcontain sensitive data, and as such, we recommend that this data be assumed as sensitive data.\nDO I NEED TO GET CONSENT FROM ALL STAFF AND PUPILS BEFORE I CAN MONITOR THEMIN SCHOOL WITH NETSUPPORT DNA?\nGenerally, no \u2013 you do, however, need to give a clear notification that there is a monitoringsystem in place. This notification should explain that NetSupport DNA will record what they typeand do, so staff and pupils understand what is monitored for safeguarding purposes.

The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms of Use as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under the Terms of Use and applicable law.

This means that the product has been independently, reviewed, and certified by kidSAFE to meet certain standards of online safety and privacy.\n* **Personal Information**, or **PI**, is defined in this policy to mirror the text of the California Consumer Privacy Act (**CCPA**) and means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.\n* We take your privacy seriously, and **we never monetize your PI**; we use it to enhance your experience with opportunities like special promotions and offers.\n* During Account registration, the only information we may ask you to provide about a child who will be using the Services is the child\u2019s first name (or nickname), birth month and year, and gender. We also will ask you to choose an Academic Difficulty Level for each child.\n* Other than in the places and for the purposes explicitly disclosed in this Privacy Policy, and Avatar names that are displayed when you choose to allow your Child Users to use the Services chat feature, we do not knowingly collect any PI directly from Child Users under age 13. For more information about where in the Services we may collect PI from children, including how our chat feature works, please see [Section 3(B) (Information We Collect from Users)](#information-we-collect) below.\n* We do not ask for certain sensitive PI such as social security numbers, driver\u2019s license numbers, or biometric data. However, paying subscribers are asked for payment information when they subscribe. Please see [Section 3 (Information Collection)](#information-collection) for more information about how we safeguard payment information.\n* Because the security of your PI is important to us, we only ask for PI where it serves a business purpose and try to limit the collection of PI to only what is necessary to accomplish those purposes. We also use commercially reasonable physical, technical, and administrative security measures designed to safeguard all information collected by the Services.\n",

From all Users, we may collect chat logs and information posted or transmitted through the interactive chat feature of the Services (as described below).\nWe and our third-party service providers also use a variety of technologies, such as cookies (small text files that the Services save on your computer or mobile device), to automatically collect certain technical information from your computer or mobile device over time and across different websites, including when you use the Services, such as your browser type, operating system, device type, the page served, your IP address, the approximate geolocation of your computer or mobile device, and the websites you visited prior to visiting the Services.
