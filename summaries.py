        Privacy Policy
    1. Privacy Policy
    At Doodle, we’re serious about the security of the data on our servers and the protection of the privacy of our users.  We employ several security professionals that work exclusively on technical and organizational security during operations and further development of the product. You can meet them on our team page. We continually take steps to protect your information against loss, misuse, unauthorized access, unauthorized disclosure, manipulation, or destruction.    
    
    As a basic principle, the Swiss Federal Data Protection Act (FADP) applies to the processing of your personal data. In certain circumstances, for example if you access our offers from a Member State of the European Union, the European Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR) may also apply. If you access our services from the State of California, USA, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) may also apply.
    
    Doodle AG participates in the IAB Transparency and Consent Framework 2.0 (IAB TCF 2.0 or Framework), an industry standard that allows all participants in the digital advertising market (publishers, advertisers, technology service providers, etc.) to transparently inform end users about the processing of your personal data and to give you the opportunity to agree or disagree with it. As a participant in the IAB TCF 2.0, Doodle AG adheres to the technical and legal (guidelines) requirements of the framework and offers you, the end user, the opportunity to manage your privacy settings via a Consent Management Platform (CMP). Doodle AG uses the CMP solutions from OneTrust (Web; CMP ID # 28) and TX Group AG (Mobile Native; CMP ID # 359).

         6. Advertising
    Advertising is one of Doodle’s revenue streams. Therefore, Doodle displays advertisements on some of the services, e.g. on certain web pages or in e-mails. These advertisements can be targeted based on the information that is available to Doodle, e.g. language, IP address, poll content, etc. This targeting is always an automated process; none of the information used for targeting is analyzed manually or made available to advertising customers. In some cases, Doodle displays advertisements from Google’s AdSense or AdExchange network. These advertisements can be targeted based on the poll content. Google does not disclose that information and only uses it for the intended purpose. You can review Google’s Ads Privacy Policy here: http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/. Furthermore, you can use Google’s Ads Preferences Manager to configure the right ads settings for you. We also use other third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site.

        7. Outdated and completed polls
    You can delete outdated or completed (or, in fact, any) polls manually at any time using the admin link. When deleting a poll, that poll’s information will be deleted from the Doodle application databases but may be archived in some other form for internal analytical purposes to improve the product for you. Log data will not be deleted. Furthermore, outdated polls are automatically deleted from time to time, but no earlier than 30 days after the last date in the poll, or 30 days after the last access to a poll without dates. Polls created with premium accounts will not be deleted automatically as long as the subscription remains active. Should the subscription expire, the deletion rules mentioned above apply to all polls associated to the account after 30 days of expiry.
    
    8. Inactive accounts
    Doodle can delete user accounts if they remain inactive (i.e. not accessed) for 1 year or longer.
    
    9. Unauthorized access
    Doodle implements several mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to polls, accounts, or other data.
    
    To access a poll, you use the unique link which Doodle provides and which contains a random access code. This link is an important element to prevent unauthorized access to a poll. You should send this link only to authorized people, i.e., the people you wish to participate in your poll. User-accounts are protected by passwords. You should choose a secure password and ensure its confidentiality to prevent unauthorized access to your account.
    
    10. Inviting from Doodle
    As an option, you can contact and invite people to participate in a poll from Doodle. In this case, Doodle needs to know the e-mail addresses of the people to be contacted. You can enter these e-mail addresses in the corresponding form. Doodle stores these e-mail addresses in your user-account for your convenience; Doodle will be able to offer you the same contacts again next time you use the service. You can have Doodle delete all stored e-mail addresses any time using the corresponding function in your user-account.
    
    General remark: Like all other personal information, Doodle will not share participants’ e-mail addresses with third parties. Doodle will not send any e-mail communication to participants’ e-mail addresses without a without a lawful ground.
    
    11. Contacts integration
    As an alternative (or complement) to the Doodle contacts, you can use your existing Google contacts to gain access to the e-mail addresses of the people to be contacted. In this case, you authorize Doodle to access your Google contacts. Your Google contacts will still be stored at Google. Please note also: The process of accessing your Google contacts is set up (thanks to OAuth) to make sure that Doodle at no time has access to your Google password.
    
    12. Calendar integration
    You can connect Doodle with your calendar to make the scheduling process even easier and more efficient. There are two types of calendars: online and offline.
    
    Online calendars like Google calendar are constantly accessible via their respective interfaces. Doodle can store certain calendar data to improve performance (caching) and to personalise scheduling.
    
    In either case, calendar data on Doodle can be deleted at any time.
    
    13. Communication between you and Doodle
    If you send Doodle a message, this message can be stored to process it, to compile statistical information, to improve our services and support, or to get in touch with you.
    
    14. For user surveys and market research
    We use the data you provide exclusively to improve the user experience and to further develop our products. The results consist solely of aggregated and anonymous data. If you have given your consent, you may also be contacted by other companies of the TX Group for example to participate in other user surveys.
    
    15. Payment processing
    Doodle supports the leading payment processing provider, PayPal. You can find their privacy policies here: PayPal. To make payments as easy and user-friendly as possible, Doodle sends your name and e-mail address to Paypal during a payment process. All this information would be requested by the provider anyway. Doodle furthermore employs Stripe for credit card payments. You can find the privacy policy here.
    
    16. Location of data
    The listing and locations of subprocessors authorized to process data on Doodle’s behalf can be found here.
    
    17. Transfer of Personal Data abroad
    We are entitled to transfer your Personal Data abroad, including to third party companies (designated service providers) insofar as this is expedient for the Data Processing described in this Privacy Statement. The recipients will be obliged to protect Your Data to the same extent as ourselves. If the level of data protection in a particular country is lower than that applicable in Switzerland, we will ensure under contract that the level of protection for your Personal Data is equivalent to that applicable in Switzerland. We shall ensure this through one or more of the following measures:
    
    by concluding EU Model Clauses with the appointed service providers, cf. 
    
    through the appointed service providers having in place Binding Corporate Rules (BCR) that are recognised by a European data protection authority, cf. 
    
    18. Sharing personal information
    Doodle uses personal information according to the Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy.
    
    Doodle may share personal information with other companies or individuals only in the following limited circumstances: (i) Doodle has your consent; (ii) Doodle has good faith that there is a legal obligation to share the data; (iii) Doodle needs to access or share the data to protect the security of the service or of others users’ data; (iv) Doodle needs to access or share the data to protect Doodle’s rights and property or to enforce the Terms of Service.
    
    19. Data retention
    We shall only retain your data for as long as is legally necessary or in accordance with the purpose for which they were processed. If we carry out analyses, we shall store your data until the analysis has been concluded. If we store your data on the basis of a contractual relationship with you, these data will remain stored for at least the duration of the contractual relationship and at most for the duration of the limitation periods within which any claims may be brought by or against us, or for the duration of statutory or contractual duties of retention.
    
    20. Legal basis
    We shall only process your Personal Data in accordance with principles of data protection and if there is a legal basis to do so. If in furtherance of the establishment or implementation of our contract, it shall serve as the legal basis. Otherwise, we have an interest in continuously improving our Offers, adjusting our Offers in line with your needs and showing you advertising that may be of interest to you. This is necessary in order to develop our Offers further, as well as to be able to finance and guarantee the security of our Offers. We act on the presumption that our interests are predominant. If you have consented to data Processing, this consent will apply.
    
    21. Right of erasure
    In accordance with applicable European legislation you can delete your account and the events you own from the system in the account section of Sites. It is however possible that another user invites, or informs, you about an event again in the future. If you don’t want this either we can block your email address.
    
    22. Your rights
    You have the right to exercise your data protection rights at any time and to request information as to whether and which Personal Data relating to you has been processed by us. You may also arrange for your Personal Data to be corrected, blocked or cancelled at any time in writing, enclosing appropriate proof of your identity, by [email protected].

    Please note that we may be required to retain your Personal Data in part even after a request for blocking or cancellation under the terms of our statutory or contractual retention requirements (such as for accounting purposes) and in such an eventuality will only block your Personal Data insofar as necessary for this purpose. In addition, the cancellation of your Personal Data may have the effect that you are no longer able to acquire or use the services registered by you. Under certain circumstances, you have the right to require us to provide you or a third party specified by you with your personal data in a commonly used format.
    
    In addition, you have the right to make a complaint concerning the data processing in question with the competent supervisory authority. You can do this with the supervisory authority at your place of residence, at your place of work or at the place of the alleged data breach.

    Maxar uses your personal information in a variety of ways, depending on how you interact with our Services. These uses may include: 

    To maintain and provide you with access to our Services. 

    To provide customer support and respond to your inquiries or instructions concerning our Services. 

    To fulfill underlying transactions on our Services, including, when applicable, sharing personal information with our regulators or to obtain necessary licenses. 

    To allow access to account information and Service features. 

    To deliver confirmations, account information, notifications, updates, and similar operational communications. 

    To improve your online experience and the quality of our Services. 

    To market and advertise our Services. 

    To maintain the integrity of our network and address security issues involving our Services.  

    To comply with legal and/or regulatory requirements. 

    To prevent or monitor crime or fraud, protect our legal rights and perform contractual obligations. 

    We also use the information you provide to send you communications, including promotional messages about Maxar and topics of interest, as permitted by local law and subject to your contact preferences. Although we hope you will find our promotional communications of interest, you are able to opt out of receiving them by contacting Maxar as indicated in the How to Contact Us section of this Statement. 

    We also may use the information in other ways for which we provide specific notice at the time of collection. 

    In addition, we may use information collected through automated means for the purposes set forth above, including by customizing your visits to our Services, analyzing the manner in which all of our users interact with our Services and online advertisements, delivering content tailored to our users’ interests and managing our Services and other aspects of our business. 

    The Legal Basis for Our Use of Personal Data (European Economic Area visitors only) 
    If you are located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), our legal basis for collecting and using the personal data we collect (described above) depends on the personal data we collect and the context under which we collect it. In any case, we will collect and process your personal data only in at least one of the following circumstances: (i) we have your consent, (ii) where the processing is for our legitimate interests, (iii) where we have a legal obligation to collect the data, or (iv) where the personal data is necessary to perform a contract with you, and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. 

    If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear and also tell you whether the requirement for that information is mandatory and explain any consequences to you if you do not provide the information. Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information based on our legitimate interests, we will provide clear notice to describe our legitimate interests. 

    Maxar Technologies Holdings Inc. is the data controller of the personal information collected from individuals in the EEA, unless otherwise indicated.  

    If you have any questions about our legal basis for processing personal data or need to contact us regarding your data rights, please contact us at compliance@maxar.com.

        Information We Share 
    We do not sell or otherwise disclose personal information we collect about you, except as described in this Privacy Statement. We may share personal information with contractors and service providers who perform services on our behalf based on our instructions. We may share certain personal information with Maxar subsidiaries and affiliates to provide a more unified user experience for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement. These subsidiaries and affiliates may be located in different countries than your own and may have different and potentially lower data privacy standards than those of your home country. 

    In addition, we may disclose personal information if we are required to do so by law or legal process, to law enforcement authorities or other government entities, and when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent harm or financial loss, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual espionage, cybersecurity or security events or other fraudulent or illegal activity. We also reserve the right to transfer personal information in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a reorganization, spin-off, dissolution or liquidation). 

    Location of Data Processing 
    Personal information that Maxar processes or controls is transferred to, and stored and processed in, the United States or any other country in which Maxar or its affiliates or subcontractors maintain facilities. The data protection laws in these countries are different from, and could be less stringent than, those in your country of residence. When we transfer personal information to recipients in other countries, we take steps to see that the information we collect under this Privacy Statement is processed according to the provisions of this Privacy Statement and the requirements of applicable law wherever the data is located. 

    If you are located in the EEA, the United Kingdom (“UK”) or Switzerland, we will comply with applicable legal requirements providing adequate protection for the transfer of personal information to recipients in countries outside of the EEA, the UK or Switzerland. For transfers within or between Maxar and its subsidiaries and affiliates, the steps we take include entering into the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses which contractually obligate each member to ensure that personal information receives an adequate and consistent level of protection. If we transfer personal information outside of Maxar or to contractors and service providers who perform services on our behalf based on our instructions, we will obtain contractual commitments from them to protect personal information.  

    Retention of Personal Information 
    Maxar stores your personal information for as long as you use the Services, and no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the information was collected, for which it is legitimately further processed, or required for compliance with legal requirements. Thereafter, Maxar retains personal information for a period of time set forth in its corporate retention schedules. In the case of data obtained under business-to-business agreements, Maxar retains personal information according to the timeframes set forth in those relevant customer agreements, or in lieu of an agreement, for as long as a legitimate business purpose exists. 

    Security of Personal Information 
    Maxar is committed to helping protect the security of your information. We have implemented and will maintain appropriate administrative, technical and organizational measures to protect your information against accidental loss, destruction or alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, or unlawful destruction. Networks, however, cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and we cannot ensure the security of any personal information provided to us. 

    If you believe your information has been compromised, please notify us immediately at compliance@maxar.com. 

    Your Rights and Choices 
    We offer you certain choices in connection with the personal information we collect from you. To update your preferences or elect any of your rights, please contact us as indicated in the How to Contact Us section of this Privacy Statement.  

    To the extent provided by the law of your jurisdiction, you may request access to the personal information we maintain about you or request that we correct, amend, delete or block the information by contacting us as indicated below. Where provided by law, you may withdraw any consent you previously provided to us or object at any time on legitimate grounds to the processing of your personal information, and we will apply your preferences going forward. Please note that we are obligated to verify your identity before we provide you with any personal data. If you request a change to or deletion of your personal data, please note that we may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting such change or deletion. Some of your information may also remain in our systems and other records where necessary for compliance with applicable law. 

    If you live in California, you have additional privacy rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018. Please contact us at compliance@maxar.com for more information.

    Our Services may provide links to other websites for your convenience and information. These websites may operate independently from us. Linked sites may have their own privacy notices or policies, which we strongly suggest you review. To the extent any linked websites are not owned or controlled by us, we are not responsible for the websites’ content, any use of the websites, or the privacy practices of the websites, even though you may enter that site directly from visiting ours. 

    Updates to Our Privacy Statement 
    This Privacy Statement may be updated periodically and without prior notice to you to reflect changes in our personal information practices. We will post the updated version to this website and indicate at the top of the notice when it was most recently updated. 

    Usage by Children is Prohibited 
    We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

        Privacy Policy
    As of July 20th, 2018

    IFTTT Inc. (IFTTT) takes the private nature of your personal information very seriously. This Privacy Policy describes how we treat the information we collect when you visit and use the IFTTT website located at ifttt.com (the "Site") and the services offered by IFTTT (the Site, Mobile Apps, and services referred to as the "Service"). Please read this Privacy Policy to learn more about the ways in which IFTTT uses and protects your personal information. By using the Service you acknowledge and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms, please do not use the Service or access our Site.

    The IFTTT Service is not intended for use by children. If you are under 18, you may use the Service only with involvement of a parent or guardian. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 16. If you are under 16, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 16, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 16 may have provided us personal information, please contact us using this form and use the report abuse category.

        Information We Collect Automatically
    Browsing the Site does not require you to register for an account or provide any personal information to us. In general, IFTTT will gather some generic information automatically. This generic information may include the internet address assigned to your computer, the number and frequency of visitors to the Site, the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on the Site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on the Site or not), and your computer browser information. Generic information does not reveal the identity of the visitor. This type of aggregate data may enable us to figure out how often users use parts of the Service, help us determine customer service and Site needs, and do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and our community. IFTTT may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information, not information about you personally, to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our Service.

    We use analytics to help analyze how our users use the Services. Google Analytics uses cookies to collect information such as how often our users visit the Services, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Services. We may use the information we get from Google Analytics to improve our Services or to send you promotional messages about our Services. Google Analytics collects the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Services, but not your name or other personally identifying information. We do not combine the information generated through the use of Google Analytics with any personally identifying information. Although Google Analytics plants a persistent Cookie to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Service, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Service is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You may find additional information about Google Analytics at http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners.

    Information Collected From Other Websites and Do Not Track Policy
    Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Service. Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Service and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy. Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Our Service does not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Service and after you leave our Service.

    Information You Provide to Us
    We receive and store any information you enter on the Service or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, though you may not be able to take advantage of many Service features. The personal information you provide may be used for such purposes as responding to your questions or requests, customizing the content you see, and communicating with you about new Service features. If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the Service, we may collect such information into a file specific to you. You agree that we may use your personal information to contact you as provided herein, though our intent is that email is the only channel we will use to contact you without your consent.

    Also, once you install any Mobile Apps and enable specific Platform Services, you may be providing us with additional information, such as contacts and camera-photos on your device. Additionally, we may collect information about your location and calendar in order to provide you with more personalized Service. Again, you can choose not to provide us with certain information, though you may not be able to take advantage of many Service features.

    If you provide your third-party account credentials to us or otherwise sign in to the Services through a third party site or Platform Service, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts (“Third Party Account Information”) may be transmitted into your account with us if you authorize such transmissions, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy.

    One such service may include the ability for you to automatically transmit Third Party Account Information to your Services profile or to automatically transmit information in your Services profile to your third party account.

    In order for you to take full advantage of the Service, you must provide registration information, including an e-mail address and password. We may also request demographic information and unique identifiers in order to provide you with a more personalized service, but this information is optional. Once you register for the Service, create Applets, and/or give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. Usernames and links to public accounts are only shown on your profile with your consent. You always have the option to not provide information by choosing not to register for the Service or create any Applets. Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, and efficient experience. We only collect personal information about you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose. IFTTT does not sell or rent your personal information to third parties without your explicit consent. IFTTT may disclose information it has collected from you and/or that you have made available through the Service when it believes in good faith that the law or legal process requires it, or when it is necessary to do so to protect the rights or property of IFTTT or others. You are responsible for managing the flow of your private information from one third party Platform Service to another. If you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, that information becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others and redistributed through the internet and other media channels. For example, if you push a private post on Facebook to a public blog, the private post will no longer be private. You may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.

    Is My Information Secure?
    We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We use industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) software to protect the security of your personal information during transmission, which encrypts all of the information you input. All personal information collected from other Platform Services that you provide through the use of the Service is stored securely. Only employees who need personal information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer service representative) are granted access to it. All of our employees are kept up to date on our privacy and security practices.

    Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example, we may be forced to disclose personal information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.

    You need to work to protect against unauthorized access to your passwords and to your computer by signing off once you have finished using a shared computer. You are responsible for all actions taken with your User ID and password. Therefore we recommend that you do not disclose your password to any third parties. If you choose to share your User ID and password or your personal information with third parties, you are responsible for all actions taken with your account and therefore you should review that third party's privacy policy. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf such as if someone used your User and ID password to forward libelous material through the Service. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password.

    What about Cookies?
    When you visit the Site, we may send one or more cookies to your computer hard drive through your Web browser. A cookie is a small file containing a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Any use of cookies by us will be solely for the purposes of improving the quality of access to the Site by storing user preferences, and tracking user trends, such as how people use the Site, and their Site access preferences. Cookies tell us how and when pages in our Site are visited and by how many people. We use cookies to allow you to enter your login information less frequently. To the extent IFTTT uses cookies, such cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your username or e-mail address is. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on the Site and you may be required to reenter your password or login information more frequently. IFTTT visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using the Site. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. We recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because deleting cookies may reduce the functionality of IFTTT. We do not control the use of cookies by third parties.

    Will IFTTT Share Any of the Information it Receives with Other Entities?
    We may use third party service providers to facilitate or outsource one or more aspects of our business and therefore we may provide some of your personal information directly to these service providers. These service providers are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit their use of the information we provide them for any other purpose except to facilitate the specific outsourced IFTTT related operation, unless you have given your prior permission to them for additional uses. We may share our data, including personal information about you with our partners and joint ventures in furtherance of our business. To the extent that these entities have access to your information, they will treat it at least as protectively as they treat information they obtain from their other users. Our partners and joint ventures follow privacy practices no less protective of all users than our practices described in this document, to the extent allowed by applicable law. In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred.

    Moreover, if IFTTT, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that IFTTT goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, customer information would be one of the assets that may be transferred to or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of IFTTT may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy. IFTTT cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce laws and intellectual property rights. Therefore, in response to a verified request by law enforcement or other government officials relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your name, city, state, telephone number, and email address. We will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement or other government officials without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss; or report suspected illegal activity. This Privacy Policy applies to the IFTTT Service only. We do not exercise control over any sites that you may visit from a link on our Site. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Since IFTTT does not control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to the privacy policies of that third party. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.

    We may de-identify your Personal Information so that you are not identified as an individual, and provide that information to our partners. We may also provide aggregate usage information to our partners (or allow partners to collect that information from you), who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. However, we never disclose aggregate usage or de-identified information to a partner (or allow a partner to collect such information) in a manner that would identify you as an individual person.

    Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your personal information may be shared with third parties, and you will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.

    Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Personal Information
    Services can be disconnected at anytime though prior Applets may remain in our electronic archive. You can change your email address and contact information by going to the settings page. You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate. You may be able to add or update certain additional information via the Service. When you update information, however, we often maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records. Please note that information may remain in our records after deletion of your account. IFTTT will only update your information on third party sites or send you information (phone, sms, etc.) with your specific consent, such as when you add Applets to your account.

    Changes to this Policy
    Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Policy changes on this page. We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amend terms on the Site. All amended terms shall automatically be effective thirty (30) days after they are initially posted on the Site. Each version of this Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective date.

    EU Residents
    If you are a resident of the European Union (“EU”), United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway, or Iceland, you may have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) with respect to your Personal Data, as outlined below.

    For this section, we use the terms “Personal Data” and “processing” as they are defined in the GDPR, but “Personal Data” generally means information that can be used to individually identify a person, and “processing” generally covers actions that can be performed in connection with data such as collection, use, storage and disclosure. IFTTT will be the controller of your Personal Data processed in connection with the Service.

    If there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Privacy Policy, the policy or portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict. If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following applies to you, please contact us at IFTTT@gdpr-rep.com.

Please pay careful attention to your account privacy settings on the Service, which will impact what information about you is visible and may give you some control over what information is shared. If your user settings indicate that your profile is “visible”, your rental activity, social sharing activity, YES-ing activity, as well as your public profile information will be accessible to other users of the Service. If you do not want information about you shared in this way, adjust your settings so that your profile is only visible to yourself (in which case your user name will still be publicly available). If you are concerned with maintaining your privacy, we suggest that you choose a user name for the Service that does not reference your real name.

    Collection and Use of Non-Identifying Information

    We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose information in a form that does not personally identify you (“Non-Identifying Information“) for any purpose. Non-Identifying Information can include certain personally identifiable information that has been de-identified; that is, information that has been rendered anonymous. We and/or our third party service providers obtain Non-Identifying Information about you from information that you provide us, either separately or together with your Personal Information. We and/or our third party service providers also automatically collect certain Non-Identifying Information from you when you access our Service.

    Certain Non-Identifying Information about you would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers in a way that enables you to be identified. However, the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other Non-Identifying information. We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other users or sources to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of our products and services, and to analyze and understand how our products and services are used. We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically.

    Non-Identifying Information We Automatically Collect

    When you access our Service, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies, now and hereafter devised, that automatically record certain usage information. This information may include your Internet Protocol address (and other unique identifiers for the particular device you use to access the Internet), browser type, your web or application request, your interaction with our Service, the webpage or other feature you were using before you came to our Service, pages of our Website that you visit, information you search for via our Service, access times and dates, and other similar information. We use this information for a variety of purposes, including analyzing and enhancing our products and services, and to help personalize our Service for you. We do not treat this information as Personal Information (except to the extent required by local law), although if we combine it with the Personal Information you provide, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information. We and our third-party service providers may automatically collect Non-Identifying Information using various methods, including, without limitation, cookies.

    A cookie is a small data file transferred to your computer when it is used to access our Service. Cookies may be used for many purposes, including to enable certain features of our Service, to better understand how you interact with our Service and to monitor aggregate usage by visitors and online traffic routing. You may be able to instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the online services you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of our online services or all functionality of our online services.

    INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE

    Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we will not share your Personal Information with other companies or individuals outside of MLNP unless we have received your consent. Non-Identifying Information may be provided to third parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.

    Our Service Providers and Other Third Parties

    We may engage third party companies and individuals to perform services on our behalf (e.g., without limitation, payment processing, software maintenance services, e-mail notifications, product delivery services, database management, web analytics and other services). These third parties may have access to your Personal Information. If they do, this access is provided so that they may perform these tasks on our behalf and they are not authorized by us to otherwise use or disclose your Personal Information, except to the extent required by law.

    Compliance with Laws, Legal Process and Authorities

    We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of us or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical or legally actionable.

    Data Transfer

    MLNP processes personal information on our servers in the United States of America. Your Personal Information may be transferred to, and used by, entities located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. Such export is a requirement of providing your information to MLNP, and you hereby consent to such export in all respects.

    Business Transfers

    Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, we may sell, transfer or otherwise disclose some or all of our assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy. It’s MLNP’s practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.

    GENERAL

    Changing or Deleting Your Information

    MLNP makes good faith efforts to enable features on the Service that provide individuals with reasonable access to Personal Information that they have provided to MLNP for purposes of their user profiles and the reasonable ability to review and correct it or ask for deletion, as applicable, if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. To view and change Personal Information that you have directly provided to MLNP via the Service, you can log in to your user account on the Service, or contact MLNP via e-mail to curators@makelovenotporn.tv. Please note we may retain server/backup copies of all such data, and that we may decline to process change or deletion requests that we deem to be unreasonable, or require disproportionate technical effort, or jeopardize the privacy of others.

    Security

    We employ appropriate security measures to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These security measures include administrative, technical, and physical precautions to safeguard your Personal Information against loss, theft, and misuse. Please be advised, however, that while we strive to protect your Personal Information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and are not responsible for the theft, destruction or inadvertent disclosure of your personally identifiable information.

    Third Party Products and Services

    Our products and services may contain links to, or content from, third party websites and other products and services. The fact that we link to a website or display an advertisement or other third party content is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with any of those third parties, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices.

    We do not exercise control over third party websites, products or services. These other products and services may place their own cookies or other files on your computer or other device, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other persons and entities follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the information you submit to them or they collect from you. We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of those third parties.

    Changes to this Privacy Policy

    We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy. If we make changes, we will revise this Privacy Policy to reflect such changes and revise the effective date included at the end of this policy.

        Privacy Policy
    The NewPipe project aims to provide a private, anonymous experience for using media web services.

    We provide some self-hosted services that help us develop NewPipe and the related projects, which require a minimum of personal data to be collected by us. We take your privacy seriously and process the data you provide only for the purposes described below. We promise to notify you about changes, as long as we are able to do so (i.e., we have a way to contact you, for example your e-mail address).

    We process and store data based on the EU General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 2016 in combination with the Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016) law as well as the German Bundesdatenschutzgesetz (short BDSG, a German federal data protection law) in its latest version.

    The following document fulfills the requirements of the GDPR Articles 13 and 14, and informs you about the collection and processing of personal data within our project.

    All data is stored in a German datacenter, and therefore the data is subject to German law as well as EU law.

    Data collection on the NewPipe website (including blog with comments and press kit)
    We do not collect any personal data of visitors of the NewPipe website. We do not install cookies on your system, and we do not track our users. Personal data such as the IP address are only processed for the purpose of serving the pages by our webserver software, and are deleted from the memory immediately after the page has been sent to the user.

    Server logs
    To have a minimum of control in scenarios where our website is abused, for example denial-of-service attacks, we configured our webserver to create a so-called acces log. This log file contains a list of all requests made to this server, each request in a separate line.

    The logged lines contain the following information:

    the IP address that was used to make the request
    a timestamp
    the URL
    the HTTP status code
    the user agent the user‘s browser sends automatically
    We need to keep logs of the IP addresses sending requests to our server. As IP addresses are considered personal data and we respect the privacy of our users, we only keep enough of the IP address to be able to able to react to abuse (e.g., DoS and other attacks).
    We calculate prefixes of the IP addresses to anonymize them as follows:

    For IPv4 addresses, we remove the last two bytes to anonymize them. For example, an IP address such as 12.34.56.78 would be logged as 12.34.0.0.
    For IPv6 addresses, we remove all bytes but the first two. For example, an IP address such as 2001:db8:85a3:8d3:1319:8a2e:370:7344 would be logged as 2001:db8:0:0:0:0:0:0 (short 2001:0db8::).
    We can not identify users from combinations of the other data. Therefore, we consider our log anonymized.

    Comments
    The NewPipe blog provides a comment section which can be used to provide feedback for the articles or the project itself. Normal visits don‘t yield any private data.

    Users have the ability to leave comments themselves. We use the excellent isso software to provide this feature.

    If a user sends a comment, the following data is collected:

    mandatory data:
    a name (can, but does not have to be a user's real name), allowing users to let others (including the NewPipe project) identify them, for example on other services, such as GitHub; the name is published next to the user's comment
    a personal comment
    optional data:
    an e-mail address, users can enter one if they want the NewPipe project to be able to contact them; it is not published and is not and won't ever be shared with third parties
    a URL to their homepage, which will be published publicly in the form of a link
    In order to fulfill legal constraints, i.e., to help investigating insults and similar criminal acts, we store the IP addresses that were used to create the comments. If we would not store them, we could be prosecuted ourselves.

    The IP addresses and the other data are stored permanently.

    In order to help users to comment more easily in the future, isso stores the contents of the name, e-mail address and URL fields of the comment form in the user's browser's localStorage. LocalStorage is a browser-side method for storing data persistently, and is bound to a single website. It has been standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), and has been published in form of a W3C Recommendation in 2016.

    LocalStorage behaves different than the well-known cookies. Unlike cookies, the localStorage's contents are never sent to our servers. We cannot change or copy them. They're only used by isso to fill them into the comment form on future visits. If you do not want isso to store anything in your localStorage, please configure your browser accordingly by either adding an exception for the NewPipe website, or deactivating localStorage completely. So-called "private modes" some browsers provide may also prevent localStorage from being created. Please refer to your browser's manual for details.

    Data collection and processing by Sentry, our bug report tracking system
    We maintain an instance of Sentry, a bug tracking and aggregation system, in order to process user-provided bug reports including crash logs and messages.

    We implemented a fully self-hosted bug reporting system that provides a unique level of transparency to the user. When NewPipe crashes on an Android device, the user is shown a dialog containing a summary of the information NewPipe was able to gain about the bug. The user can now opt to send the full details to the NewPipe project in order to allow us to identify and hopefully fix the bug. When a user clicks the send button, NewPipe composes an e-mail via the Android system (i.e., in the configured standard e-mail client) containing the details in a machine-readable format called JSON. JSON is a text-based format, allowing users to read the data and check exactly what data could be sent to us. Users can remove or anonymize data which they do not want to be shared, as long as the JSON format is not broken (in this case, our system can not parse the e-mail any more).

    The JSON part contains the following information:

    the e-mail address of the sender
    the type/name of the error
    the URL of the requested page that caused NewPipe to crash
    the language set in NewPipe's settings
    time of the incident (minute accuracy)
    name of the used application
    version of the used application
    operating system name, version and API level (e.g., Linux Android 4.4.4 - 19)
    the error protocol (stacktrace)
    Our bug reporting code is implemented to not embed any personal data in the JSON blob. However, we cannot guarantee that there won't be any personal data contained by accident. Also, we cannot control whether the user will add any personal data to the generated JSON data, nor can we control whether users add personal data outside it. Therefore we tried to implement our bug report system as transparently as possible, allowing the user to entirely control what data is sent. We assume that by sending an actual e-mail to the crash reporting system's address, any personal data is sent on behalf and with consent of the user. We preserve the right to process this data automatically in our Sentry system, the crash report importing software, and accompanying software. We store the data as long as it is needed for analyzations. The e-mails are stored on a self-hosted mail server, and won't be deleted before processing takes place. Often, the raw e-mail data is stored even longer, in order to allow re-imports of the data into Sentry.
    Any additional text in the e-mail that is not part of the JSON section is considered a user comment and will be processed and stored by us as well.

    Once the data has been imported, our Sentry system reorganizes the data. Bug reports which Sentry considers similar are aggregated. Sentry is configured to strip any personal data from the bug reports. This can be considered a "last line of defence", and doesn't ensure that no private data is ever collected and stored.

    Only a small circle of people has access to the Sentry system. We instruct every user to delete any report which contains personal data as soon as it is discovered. Due to the amount of bug reports we receive every day (varies from a few hundred to a few thousand e-mails every week), we can not check every report for personal data by hand. We ask you to ensure you don't send us any personal data you don't want to share with us. We consider any content in the e-mails to be sent with your consent. You may, at any time, request deletion of the data. Please see below for your rights as a user.

    Once an issue discovered by Sentry has been resolved, the reports related to it are archived in the database.

        Users' rights
    Every user has the right to request details about the personal data stored about them according to GDPR Art. 15.

    Every user has the right to request the correction or completion (GDPR Art. 16) or deletion (GDPR Art. 17) or restriction of use (GDPR Art. 18) of the data sent to us at any time.

    In many cases, due to our philosophy, the data is highly anonymized. If your data is, and we think it should be, anonymized so that we cannot associate with any user, we can most likely not delete it from our system. In these cases, however, no personal data is collected. Furthermore, if we cannot verify your identity (e.g., you use another e-mail address to request the deletion of data associated with another e-mail address), we can not delete the data from our systems either.

    According to GDPR Art. 77, you may, at any time, file a complaint about our data processing at your local data protection officer.

    According to GDPR Art. 7 paragraph 3, you may revoke any consent you gave us about storing and processing data at any time for future time.

    According to GDPR Art. 21, you may at any time dissent the processing and storing of data listed in the article.

    Note on Data Security
    All data is stored on a dedicated server administrated by the NewPipe project. Neither the hosting provider nor any other third party does have any access to the data, as it is stored encryptedly on the hard disks using so-called full-disk encryption.

    Note on Backups
    On a regular basis, backups of the data are created, and stored encryptedly on the server. After encrypting them, they are stored in different locations in Germany in order to create some redundancy, and allowing restoration in case of failures. The backups are stored up to 6 months, and are then deleted securely from the systems. The encrypted backups are stored as-is on the backup system the hosting provider provides. On systems outside the data center, they are stored with the same full-disk encryption mechanisms that are used to prevent unauthorized access to the raw data on the original server.

    Note on Abuse
    The data is processed and stored only for the purposes described above. We will not share any of the data with third parties. The published data is available on the Internet publicly, so that we can not tell whether third parties will copy them unauthorizedly. We want to state that we do not authorize any of these uses. If we should be informed about any unauthorized and illegal uses of our data, we will take appropriate measures to prevent further abuse. We encourage our users to actively help us with this by contacting the person responsible listed in this document immediately. If you wish to, you can use PGP encryption to make sure your message can not be read by anybody but you and the NewPipe team. The PGP key's ID and fingerprint can be found below the details of the person responsible.

    1. Preamble
    Welcome to our website! We place great importance upon the protection of your data and the protection of your privacy. Following, we want to describe which data we process when, for what purpose, and on which legal basis. With this, we want to explain to you how our services work and how the protection of your personal data is guaranteed.

    According to art. 4 para. 1 DSGVO, personal data includes all information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified directly or indirectly. More information can be found, among others, in art. 4 para. 1 DSGVO.

    This privacy policy can be retrieved, saved and printed at any time at https://www.metadata2go.com/privacy.

    If we cite our legitimate interest or the legitimate interest of a third party (art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) DSGVO) as the legal basis for the processing of personal data, you have the right of objection under art. 21 DSGVO:

    Under art. 21 DSGVO you have the right to

    object to the processing of personal data at any time. We will then no longer process personal data for the purpose of direct marketing or any related profiling.

    We also do not process your personal data for other purposes after an objection, unless we can provide compelling reasons worthy of protection for the processing, which outweigh your interests, rights, and freedoms or if the processing serves the assertion, exertion or defense of legal claims (cf. Art. 21 para. 1 DSGVO, so-called “restricted right of objection”). In this case, you must state the grounds for your objection which result from your specific situation.

    You can also object the processing of your personal data for reasons that arise from your specific situation, after they had been processed for scientific or historical research purposes or for statistical purposes in accordance with art. 89 para. 1 DSGVO, unless the processing is necessary for performing a task in the public interest (cf. Art. 21 para. 6 DSGVO).

    In the individual sections, we will also point out the right of objection to you separately (e.g. by using the note: “You have the right of objection”) if this right exists. There, you will also find further information on how to exercise your right of objection.

    In order to keep the following privacy policy clear, we refer to information and data privacy statements on external websites in various places by using links (cf. section “Social Networks & External Links” in this privacy policy). We strive to keep the links listed in this privacy policy up to date. Nevertheless, due to the constant updating of the linked websites, it cannot be excluded that some links do not work properly. If you notice such a link, we would be pleased if you could inform us so that we can insert the current link.
        2. Person in charge
    The person in charge of the processing of personal Data within the meaning of art. 4 para. 7 DSGVO is:

    QaamGo Web GmbH
    Fritz-Reichle-Ring 2

    Through the integration of Google AdSense, we pursue the purpose of being able to offer you interest-based advertisements, and to be able to finance our offer through the successful use of advertising media. For this, we are using the option “contextual-only advertisements” from Google AdSense. This means that Google will broadcast advertisements based on the content of our website and not on the interest profile created by you. Therefore, an analysis of your data for the purpose of profiling does not take place here. However, Google also uses cookies and web beacons in the scope of the “contextual-only advertisements” to prevent abuse, compile statistics, and prevent multiple visits.
