You do this through your browser (like Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many features that make your site experience more efficient and some of our services will not function properly. However, you can still place orders over the telephone by contacting customer service.

    Other User Information We Collect
    
    We may collect certain other information each time you visit Rockhill Sites and Features or use our Services so we can improve the overall quality of your online experience. This kind of information is not ordinarily considered personally identifying information. For example, we collect or may collect your IP address, device ID, referrer data, and browser and platform type. You do not have to register on any of the Rockhill Sites and Features or provide any Personal Information to us before we can collect this information. We may assign an ID number to your registration and link additional data to that ID number, such as the date and time you visited, the information you provide, and the links you choose to click. Like most standard website servers, we use log files to collect and store this user information. We may analyze and use this information for a variety of purposes, including operating and improving the Rockhill Sites and Features or our Services, collecting further information about and learning from user behavior and trends, and gathering demographic information. Furthermore, we may combine or link information we collect from or about you offline with information we collect from or about you online through the Rockhill Sites and Features or your use of our Services.
    
    We may also use GPS or similar geo-location technology to determine the city and/or geo-coordinates of where you are located, including when you are using a mobile device. As noted in the section on “Sharing” below, we may use and share your location information with our advertisers, merchant and survey partners, or others in order to provide you with advertising, content, surveys, offers, promotions, and rewards, or for other marketing, administrative and general business purposes, based on your location.
    
    Information We Receive from Third Parties
    
    We may also receive and supplement the information we directly collect from or about you with information from third parties. If you are on a third party website or service and you opt-in to receive information from us, the third party may forward to us your e-mail address and other information about you so that we may contact you as requested. In addition, we may receive information from advertisers, merchant or survey partners, and others to ensure that you properly receive any earned rewards or for other marketing, administrative or general business purposes. We may also supplement and combine the information we collect about you with outside records from third parties in order to enhance our ability to provide you with advertising, content, surveys, offers, promotions and rewards, and for other business purposes.
    
    Friend Referrals
    
    We may provide you with an opportunity to invite your friends, family and acquaintances (“Friends”) to use various Rockhill Sites and Features. If you elect to use our referral service for informing a Friend about any of the Rockhill Sites and Features, you will provide us with your Friend’s name and email address. Using our referral service permits us to automatically send the Friend one or more emails or other communications, on your behalf, inviting them to visit or register for the Rockhill Sites and Features (which invite may include additional subsequent reminders and communications). You warrant and represent that you have your Friend’s consent to provide us with his or her information for this purpose, and that you will not give us referral information for any person not permitted to use the Rockhill Sites and Features, including, without limitation a child under the age of 13, a person whose account has previously been suspended or deactivated, or a person residing or located in a territory where use of the Rockhill Sites and Features is not authorized.
    
    Community Features and User Content
    
    The Rockhill Sites and Features may provide you the opportunity to participate in and post text (including questions, comments, and suggestions), images, audio, videos, or other content (collectively, “User Content”) publicly through our blogs, chat rooms, forums, interactive features, third-party social networking services or other communication functionality (“Community Features”).

Your User Content may also contain metadata, which may contain information about or relating to you, that we may also collect, share and use.
    
    Note that anything you post through Community Features is public — others will have access to that User Content and may use it or share it with third parties.

In addition, by posting through our Community Features, you are agreeing that we may use your User Content and excerpts from your User Content in connection with our advertising, marketing, and promotional activities.
    
    Third-Party Links
    
    The Rockhill Sites and Features contain links to other websites that we do not own. In addition, because aspects of the Rockhill Sites and Features include third-party offers for goods, services and the like, third parties may collect your information based on your interaction with those offers. Third-party privacy practices are not covered by this Privacy Policy, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties. We encourage our users to be aware of and to read the privacy statements and similar disclosures of any third-party website that collects personally identifiable information before using or disclosing any personally identifiable information to such website.
    
    Advertising Networks and Analytics Companies
    
    We may allow other companies, commonly called third-party ad servers or advertising networks (collectively, “ad networks”), to display advertisements on the Rockhill Sites and Features. These advertisements may be based on your interests as reflected in your use of the Rockhill Sites and Features or our Services, as well as your use of other websites and services. Some of these ad networks may place a persistent cookie or other similar technology on your computer, allowing them to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad networks may compile information about where you see their advertisements online and determine which ads you click on, so that they may provide you with advertising, content, surveys, offers, promotions, and rewards that they believe will be of most interest to you. We do not have access to or control over the cookies or other similar technologies that may be placed by these parties on your computer, nor do we have responsibility for these parties’ privacy policies or information collection practices. Likewise, we may also work with consumer data resellers that buy and/or sell information to other companies for multiple purposes including offering products and services that may interest you, and we use certain third-party analytics providers to help us understand how you use the Rockhill Sites and Features or our Services, and these companies may set their own cookies and similar technologies on your computer or mobile device. These and other third parties may collect information about you, including but not limited to your online activities over time and across different websites and services, when you use the Rockhill Sites and Features or our Services, or other online websites and services. Each of these third parties has its own privacy policy that may differ from this Privacy Policy.
    
    We may share your Personal Information and other information with our advertisers, merchant and survey partners, and others for the purpose of making it easier for you to sign up for their surveys, promotions and offers, validating your communications or transactions with them, authenticating and/or validating your identification, crediting you with any earned rewards, and other business purposes. Additionally, we may share information with our service providers and other third parties to assist us in delivering content, advertising, surveys, offers, promotions and rewards to you, both on the Rockhill Sites and Features and elsewhere online, and for other marketing, administrative and general business purposes.

    The information we collect in connection with Social Features is subject to this Privacy Policy. The information collected and stored by the third-party website or service via Social Features remains subject to the third party’s privacy practices, including whether the third party continues to share information with us, the types of information shared, and your choices with regard to what is visible to others on that third-party website or service.

    Notification of Changes
    
    We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we decide to change this Privacy Policy, we will provide notice of such changes by sending you an administrative email and/or posting those changes in places on the Rockhill Sites and Features deemed appropriate by us so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances it may be shared with others.

If you do not agree to the changes, please discontinue your use of such Rockhill Sites and Features and our Services. To the extent that an arbitrator or court of applicable jurisdiction determines that applying any changes to this Privacy Policy to any prior events or circumstances would render this an illusory or unenforceable contract, such changes shall be applicable on a prospective basis only, with respect to events or circumstances occurring after the date of such changes, to the extent necessary to avoid this Privacy Policy being deemed illusory or unenforceable. In any event, if any Personal Information was previously submitted to or collected by us pursuant to an earlier version of this Privacy Policy that required a certain notice period prior to any changes being effective, any changes under this Privacy Policy will not be effective as to you or such previously-collected Personal Information until the previously-specified notice period has passed after the date of this Privacy Policy.

    We maintain security measures in place in order to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the Personal Information under our control.

Accordingly, we assume no responsibility or liability for disclosure of your Personal Information or other information due to errors in transmission, unauthorized third-party access or other causes beyond our reasonable control.

If you are located in a country outside the United States and submit Personal Information to us, you are consenting to the transfer, processing, storage and use of that information in the United States as provided in this Privacy Policy.
    
    The interpretation and application of this Privacy Policy shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of New York without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

    Advertising is one of Doodle’s revenue streams. Therefore, Doodle displays advertisements on some of the services, e.g. on certain web pages or in e-mails. These advertisements can be targeted based on the information that is available to Doodle, e.g. language, IP address, poll content, etc. This targeting is always an automated process; none of the information used for targeting is analyzed manually or made available to advertising customers. In some cases, Doodle displays advertisements from Google’s AdSense or AdExchange network. These advertisements can be targeted based on the poll content. Google does not disclose that information and only uses it for the intended purpose. You can review Google’s Ads Privacy Policy here: http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/. Furthermore, you can use Google’s Ads Preferences Manager to configure the right ads settings for you. We also use other third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site.

    7. Outdated and completed polls
    You can delete outdated or completed (or, in fact, any) polls manually at any time using the admin link. When deleting a poll, that poll’s information will be deleted from the Doodle application databases but may be archived in some other form for internal analytical purposes to improve the product for you. Log data will not be deleted. Furthermore, outdated polls are automatically deleted from time to time, but no earlier than 30 days after the last date in the poll, or 30 days after the last access to a poll without dates. Polls created with premium accounts will not be deleted automatically as long as the subscription remains active. Should the subscription expire, the deletion rules mentioned above apply to all polls associated to the account after 30 days of expiry.
    
    8. Inactive accounts
    Doodle can delete user accounts if they remain inactive (i.e. not accessed) for 1 year or longer.
    
    9. Unauthorized access
    Doodle implements several mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to polls, accounts, or other data.
    
    To access a poll, you use the unique link which Doodle provides and which contains a random access code. This link is an important element to prevent unauthorized access to a poll. You should send this link only to authorized people, i.e., the people you wish to participate in your poll. User-accounts are protected by passwords. You should choose a secure password and ensure its confidentiality to prevent unauthorized access to your account.
    
    10. Inviting from Doodle
    As an option, you can contact and invite people to participate in a poll from Doodle. In this case, Doodle needs to know the e-mail addresses of the people to be contacted. You can enter these e-mail addresses in the corresponding form. Doodle stores these e-mail addresses in your user-account for your convenience; Doodle will be able to offer you the same contacts again next time you use the service. You can have Doodle delete all stored e-mail addresses any time using the corresponding function in your user-account.
    
    General remark: Like all other personal information, Doodle will not share participants’ e-mail addresses with third parties. Doodle will not send any e-mail communication to participants’ e-mail addresses without a without a lawful ground.
    
    11. Contacts integration
    As an alternative (or complement) to the Doodle contacts, you can use your existing Google contacts to gain access to the e-mail addresses of the people to be contacted. In this case, you authorize Doodle to access your Google contacts. Your Google contacts will still be stored at Google. Please note also: The process of accessing your Google contacts is set up (thanks to OAuth) to make sure that Doodle at no time has access to your Google password.
    
    12. Calendar integration
    You can connect Doodle with your calendar to make the scheduling process even easier and more efficient. There are two types of calendars: online and offline.
    
    Online calendars like Google calendar are constantly accessible via their respective interfaces. Doodle can store certain calendar data to improve performance (caching) and to personalise scheduling.
    
    In either case, calendar data on Doodle can be deleted at any time.
    
    13. Communication between you and Doodle
    If you send Doodle a message, this message can be stored to process it, to compile statistical information, to improve our services and support, or to get in touch with you.
    
    14. For user surveys and market research
    We use the data you provide exclusively to improve the user experience and to further develop our products. The results consist solely of aggregated and anonymous data. If you have given your consent, you may also be contacted by other companies of the TX Group for example to participate in other user surveys.
    
    15. Payment processing

    20. Legal basis
    We shall only process your Personal Data in accordance with principles of data protection and if there is a legal basis to do so.

In these cases we work to ensure that the data we obtain has been collected in a manner consistent with all laws and regulations.

We will retain a User’s personal information for so long as its account is active or as reasonably needed by us to provide our Services. We may also retain and use such information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. We will not keep personal information in the system longer than is reasonably required to perform these functions.

    Sharing your personal information

    We will not use or disclose personal information for the purpose of our direct marketing to you unless: you have consented to receive direct marketing; you would reasonably expect us to use your personal details for the marketing; or we believe you may be interested in the material but it is impractical for us to obtain your consent. You may opt out of any marketing materials we send to you through an unsubscribe mechanism or by contacting us directly.

    Scope of this Statement 
    This Privacy Statement addresses personal information of individuals who use our Services, visit maxar.com, or provide their personal information to Maxar for visitation, sales, marketing or customer service purposes. This Privacy Statement does not address personal information of Maxar employees or third-party service providers, such as contractors and consultants, or applicants for those positions, that is collected in connection with such relationships. Employees, third-party service providers, and applicants should consult the other privacy statements applicable to their role or contract with Maxar.    

    Information We Collect 
    Maxar collects information from and about individuals from the individuals themselves, from individuals’ employers pursuant to a business-to-business contract between Maxar and the employer, from open sources of public information and from automated means.  

    2.1. Information Collected from Individuals or Their Employers 

    If you or your employer purchase a product or service from us, or if you or your employer request product information or updates from us, we will collect information about you to facilitate delivery and provide services related to that product or request. Similarly, if you or your employer sell a product or service to us, we may collect information about you to accomplish that transaction. If you visit a Maxar facility, we may collect certain information about you in order to permit access. Information that we collect in these various circumstances may include: 

    Contact information, such as your name, postal address, telephone and facsimile numbers, email address, country of residence, and country of citizenship. 

    Employment information, such as your employer, job title or role, department, sector, area or industry, and country of employment. 

    Account information, such as your account name, supervisor and assistant’s name, telephone number and email address. 

    Account access credentials, such as your login and password for Maxar Services, which are used to validate authorized access to Maxar Services. 

    Financial information, such as credit card or wire transfer information, and shipping and billing postal addresses.  

    Communications preferences and interests in Maxar products. 

    In some cases when you register for in-person events that are hosted by Maxar, we will collect certain additional information that is necessary to facilitate your attendance, which may include:  

    Dietary restrictions.  

    Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements. 

    2.2. Information Collected from Third-Party Sources 

    We may acquire information from third-party sources that are either publicly or commercially available. This information could include personal data such as your name, address, email address, preferences, interests, and demographic data.  

    We may combine personal information collected from individuals who use our Services with other information that we or third parties collect about you in other contexts, such as our communications with you via email or telephone, or your customer service records. We treat such combined information as personal information and protect it in accordance with this Privacy Statement. 

    2.3. Information Collected Automatically 

    When you visit a webpage affiliated with our Services, we may collect certain information by automated means, using technologies such as cookies and web server logs. 

    Cookies are files that websites send to your computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify your browser or store information or settings on your device. Our Services may use cookies, as well as other types of local storage (such as browser-based or plugin-based local storage). Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies and how to restrict or disable certain cookies. You also may be able to delete your cookies or adjust your cookie settings by visiting the browser’s settings panel. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to use all of the features of our websites and Services. 

    In conjunction with gathering information through cookies, our web servers may log information such as your device type, operating system type, browser type, domain, and other system settings as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone where your device is located. We also may record information such as the address of the webpage that referred you to our Service and the IP address of the device you use to connect to our Service. We also may log information about your interaction with the Services, such as which pages you visit. We may place tags on our web pages called “web beacons,” which are small files that link web pages to particular web servers and their cookies.   

    We may use third-party web analytics services on our Services, such as those of Google Analytics, Hotjar, Adobe Marketo Munchkin, Twitter Pixel, Facebook Pixel, LinkedIn Pixel, Demandbase Tag, and Google AdRoll. These service providers help us analyze how you use our Services. The information collected for this purpose (including your IP address and other information collected by automated means) will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers.  

    Both we and others (such as our service providers and advertising networks) may collect personal information about your online activities, over time and across third-party websites. Our Services are not designed to respond to “do not track” signals from browsers. 

    The provider of other third-party plug-ins on our Services, such as embedded videos and social sharing tools, may use automated means to collect information regarding your use of the Services and your interactions with the plug-ins. This information is subject to the privacy policies or notices of third-party plug-in providers and is not subject to this Privacy Statement.   

    How We Use the Information We Collect 
    Maxar uses your personal information in a variety of ways, depending on how you interact with our Services. These uses may include: 

    To maintain and provide you with access to our Services. 

    To provide customer support and respond to your inquiries or instructions concerning our Services. 

    To fulfill underlying transactions on our Services, including, when applicable, sharing personal information with our regulators or to obtain necessary licenses. 

    To allow access to account information and Service features. 

    To deliver confirmations, account information, notifications, updates, and similar operational communications. 

    To improve your online experience and the quality of our Services. 

    To market and advertise our Services. 

    To maintain the integrity of our network and address security issues involving our Services.  

    To comply with legal and/or regulatory requirements. 

    To prevent or monitor crime or fraud, protect our legal rights and perform contractual obligations. 

    We also use the information you provide to send you communications, including promotional messages about Maxar and topics of interest, as permitted by local law and subject to your contact preferences. Although we hope you will find our promotional communications of interest, you are able to opt out of receiving them by contacting Maxar as indicated in the How to Contact Us section of this Statement. 

    We also may use the information in other ways for which we provide specific notice at the time of collection. 

    In addition, we may use information collected through automated means for the purposes set forth above, including by customizing your visits to our Services, analyzing the manner in which all of our users interact with our Services and online advertisements, delivering content tailored to our users’ interests and managing our Services and other aspects of our business. 

    The Legal Basis for Our Use of Personal Data (European Economic Area visitors only) 
    If you are located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), our legal basis for collecting and using the personal data we collect (described above) depends on the personal data we collect and the context under which we collect it. In any case, we will collect and process your personal data only in at least one of the following circumstances: (i) we have your consent, (ii) where the processing is for our legitimate interests, (iii) where we have a legal obligation to collect the data, or (iv) where the personal data is necessary to perform a contract with you, and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. 

    If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear and also tell you whether the requirement for that information is mandatory and explain any consequences to you if you do not provide the information. Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information based on our legitimate interests, we will provide clear notice to describe our legitimate interests. 

    Maxar Technologies Holdings Inc. is the data controller of the personal information collected from individuals in the EEA, unless otherwise indicated.  

    If you have any questions about our legal basis for processing personal data or need to contact us regarding your data rights, please contact us at compliance@maxar.com.     

    Information We Share 
    We do not sell or otherwise disclose personal information we collect about you, except as described in this Privacy Statement. We may share personal information with contractors and service providers who perform services on our behalf based on our instructions. We may share certain personal information with Maxar subsidiaries and affiliates to provide a more unified user experience for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement. These subsidiaries and affiliates may be located in different countries than your own and may have different and potentially lower data privacy standards than those of your home country. 

    In addition, we may disclose personal information if we are required to do so by law or legal process, to law enforcement authorities or other government entities, and when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent harm or financial loss, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual espionage, cybersecurity or security events or other fraudulent or illegal activity. We also reserve the right to transfer personal information in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a reorganization, spin-off, dissolution or liquidation). 

    Location of Data Processing 
    Personal information that Maxar processes or controls is transferred to, and stored and processed in, the United States or any other country in which Maxar or its affiliates or subcontractors maintain facilities. The data protection laws in these countries are different from, and could be less stringent than, those in your country of residence. When we transfer personal information to recipients in other countries, we take steps to see that the information we collect under this Privacy Statement is processed according to the provisions of this Privacy Statement and the requirements of applicable law wherever the data is located. 

    If you are located in the EEA, the United Kingdom (“UK”) or Switzerland, we will comply with applicable legal requirements providing adequate protection for the transfer of personal information to recipients in countries outside of the EEA, the UK or Switzerland. For transfers within or between Maxar and its subsidiaries and affiliates, the steps we take include entering into the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses which contractually obligate each member to ensure that personal information receives an adequate and consistent level of protection. If we transfer personal information outside of Maxar or to contractors and service providers who perform services on our behalf based on our instructions, we will obtain contractual commitments from them to protect personal information.  

    Retention of Personal Information 
    Maxar stores your personal information for as long as you use the Services, and no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the information was collected, for which it is legitimately further processed, or required for compliance with legal requirements. Thereafter, Maxar retains personal information for a period of time set forth in its corporate retention schedules. In the case of data obtained under business-to-business agreements, Maxar retains personal information according to the timeframes set forth in those relevant customer agreements, or in lieu of an agreement, for as long as a legitimate business purpose exists. 

    Security of Personal Information 
    Maxar is committed to helping protect the security of your information. We have implemented and will maintain appropriate administrative, technical and organizational measures to protect your information against accidental loss, destruction or alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, or unlawful destruction. Networks, however, cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and we cannot ensure the security of any personal information provided to us. 

    If you believe your information has been compromised, please notify us immediately at compliance@maxar.com. 

    Your Rights and Choices 
    We offer you certain choices in connection with the personal information we collect from you. To update your preferences or elect any of your rights, please contact us as indicated in the How to Contact Us section of this Privacy Statement.  

    To the extent provided by the law of your jurisdiction, you may request access to the personal information we maintain about you or request that we correct, amend, delete or block the information by contacting us as indicated below. Where provided by law, you may withdraw any consent you previously provided to us or object at any time on legitimate grounds to the processing of your personal information, and we will apply your preferences going forward. Please note that we are obligated to verify your identity before we provide you with any personal data. If you request a change to or deletion of your personal data, please note that we may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting such change or deletion. Some of your information may also remain in our systems and other records where necessary for compliance with applicable law. 

    If you live in California, you have additional privacy rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018. Please contact us at compliance@maxar.com for more information.  

    Links to Other Websites 
    Our Services may provide links to other websites for your convenience and information. These websites may operate independently from us. Linked sites may have their own privacy notices or policies, which we strongly suggest you review. To the extent any linked websites are not owned or controlled by us, we are not responsible for the websites’ content, any use of the websites, or the privacy practices of the websites, even though you may enter that site directly from visiting ours. 

    Updates to Our Privacy Statement 
    This Privacy Statement may be updated periodically and without prior notice to you to reflect changes in our personal information practices. We will post the updated version to this website and indicate at the top of the notice when it was most recently updated. 

    Usage by Children is Prohibited 
    We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child, please contact us as indicated in the How to Contact Us section of this Privacy Statement.

    As of July 20th, 2018

    IFTTT Inc. (IFTTT) takes the private nature of your personal information very seriously. This Privacy Policy describes how we treat the information we collect when you visit and use the IFTTT website located at ifttt.com (the "Site") and the services offered by IFTTT (the Site, Mobile Apps, and services referred to as the "Service"). Please read this Privacy Policy to learn more about the ways in which IFTTT uses and protects your personal information. By using the Service you acknowledge and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms, please do not use the Service or access our Site.

    The IFTTT Service is not intended for use by children. If you are under 18, you may use the Service only with involvement of a parent or guardian. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 16. If you are under 16, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 16, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 16 may have provided us personal information, please contact us using this form and use the report abuse category.

    Information We Collect Automatically
    Browsing the Site does not require you to register for an account or provide any personal information to us. In general, IFTTT will gather some generic information automatically. This generic information may include the internet address assigned to your computer, the number and frequency of visitors to the Site, the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on the Site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on the Site or not), and your computer browser information. Generic information does not reveal the identity of the visitor. This type of aggregate data may enable us to figure out how often users use parts of the Service, help us determine customer service and Site needs, and do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and our community. IFTTT may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information, not information about you personally, to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our Service.

    We use analytics to help analyze how our users use the Services. Google Analytics uses cookies to collect information such as how often our users visit the Services, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Services. We may use the information we get from Google Analytics to improve our Services or to send you promotional messages about our Services. Google Analytics collects the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Services, but not your name or other personally identifying information. We do not combine the information generated through the use of Google Analytics with any personally identifying information. Although Google Analytics plants a persistent Cookie to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Service, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Service is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You may find additional information about Google Analytics at http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners.

    Information Collected From Other Websites and Do Not Track Policy
    Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Service. Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Service and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy. Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Our Service does not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Service and after you leave our Service.

    Information You Provide to Us
    We receive and store any information you enter on the Service or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, though you may not be able to take advantage of many Service features. The personal information you provide may be used for such purposes as responding to your questions or requests, customizing the content you see, and communicating with you about new Service features. If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the Service, we may collect such information into a file specific to you. You agree that we may use your personal information to contact you as provided herein, though our intent is that email is the only channel we will use to contact you without your consent.

    Also, once you install any Mobile Apps and enable specific Platform Services, you may be providing us with additional information, such as contacts and camera-photos on your device. Additionally, we may collect information about your location and calendar in order to provide you with more personalized Service. Again, you can choose not to provide us with certain information, though you may not be able to take advantage of many Service features.

    If you provide your third-party account credentials to us or otherwise sign in to the Services through a third party site or Platform Service, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts (“Third Party Account Information”) may be transmitted into your account with us if you authorize such transmissions, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy.

    One such service may include the ability for you to automatically transmit Third Party Account Information to your Services profile or to automatically transmit information in your Services profile to your third party account.

    In order for you to take full advantage of the Service, you must provide registration information, including an e-mail address and password. We may also request demographic information and unique identifiers in order to provide you with a more personalized service, but this information is optional. Once you register for the Service, create Applets, and/or give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. Usernames and links to public accounts are only shown on your profile with your consent. You always have the option to not provide information by choosing not to register for the Service or create any Applets. Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, and efficient experience. We only collect personal information about you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose. IFTTT does not sell or rent your personal information to third parties without your explicit consent. IFTTT may disclose information it has collected from you and/or that you have made available through the Service when it believes in good faith that the law or legal process requires it, or when it is necessary to do so to protect the rights or property of IFTTT or others. You are responsible for managing the flow of your private information from one third party Platform Service to another. If you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, that information becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others and redistributed through the internet and other media channels. For example, if you push a private post on Facebook to a public blog, the private post will no longer be private. You may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.

    Is My Information Secure?
    We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We use industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) software to protect the security of your personal information during transmission, which encrypts all of the information you input. All personal information collected from other Platform Services that you provide through the use of the Service is stored securely. Only employees who need personal information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer service representative) are granted access to it. All of our employees are kept up to date on our privacy and security practices.

    Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example, we may be forced to disclose personal information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.

    You need to work to protect against unauthorized access to your passwords and to your computer by signing off once you have finished using a shared computer. You are responsible for all actions taken with your User ID and password. Therefore we recommend that you do not disclose your password to any third parties. If you choose to share your User ID and password or your personal information with third parties, you are responsible for all actions taken with your account and therefore you should review that third party's privacy policy. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf such as if someone used your User and ID password to forward libelous material through the Service. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password.

    What about Cookies?
    When you visit the Site, we may send one or more cookies to your computer hard drive through your Web browser. A cookie is a small file containing a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Any use of cookies by us will be solely for the purposes of improving the quality of access to the Site by storing user preferences, and tracking user trends, such as how people use the Site, and their Site access preferences. Cookies tell us how and when pages in our Site are visited and by how many people. We use cookies to allow you to enter your login information less frequently. To the extent IFTTT uses cookies, such cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your username or e-mail address is. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on the Site and you may be required to reenter your password or login information more frequently. IFTTT visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using the Site. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. We recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because deleting cookies may reduce the functionality of IFTTT. We do not control the use of cookies by third parties.

    Will IFTTT Share Any of the Information it Receives with Other Entities?
    We may use third party service providers to facilitate or outsource one or more aspects of our business and therefore we may provide some of your personal information directly to these service providers. These service providers are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit their use of the information we provide them for any other purpose except to facilitate the specific outsourced IFTTT related operation, unless you have given your prior permission to them for additional uses. We may share our data, including personal information about you with our partners and joint ventures in furtherance of our business. To the extent that these entities have access to your information, they will treat it at least as protectively as they treat information they obtain from their other users. Our partners and joint ventures follow privacy practices no less protective of all users than our practices described in this document, to the extent allowed by applicable law. In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred.

    Moreover, if IFTTT, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that IFTTT goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, customer information would be one of the assets that may be transferred to or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of IFTTT may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy. IFTTT cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce laws and intellectual property rights. Therefore, in response to a verified request by law enforcement or other government officials relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your name, city, state, telephone number, and email address. We will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement or other government officials without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss; or report suspected illegal activity. This Privacy Policy applies to the IFTTT Service only. We do not exercise control over any sites that you may visit from a link on our Site. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Since IFTTT does not control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to the privacy policies of that third party. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.

    We may de-identify your Personal Information so that you are not identified as an individual, and provide that information to our partners. We may also provide aggregate usage information to our partners (or allow partners to collect that information from you), who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. However, we never disclose aggregate usage or de-identified information to a partner (or allow a partner to collect such information) in a manner that would identify you as an individual person.

    Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your personal information may be shared with third parties, and you will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.

    Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Personal Information
    Services can be disconnected at anytime though prior Applets may remain in our electronic archive. You can change your email address and contact information by going to the settings page. You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate. You may be able to add or update certain additional information via the Service. When you update information, however, we often maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records. Please note that information may remain in our records after deletion of your account. IFTTT will only update your information on third party sites or send you information (phone, sms, etc.) with your specific consent, such as when you add Applets to your account.

    User Communications
    You may input your contact information into the Service so that IFTTT may contact you. When you enter your contact information or send an email or other communication to IFTTT, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries and respond to your requests. We do not use your email address or contact information to send commercial or marketing messages nor do we give or sell this information to any third parties. To the extent your e-mail address is provided to IFTTT, you may receive e-mail or other communications from us.

    Your California Privacy Rights
    Under California Civil Code Sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice identifying the categories of personal information which we share with our affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties.

You may also submit a written request to IFTTT Inc., PO Box 590547, San Francisco, CA 94159-0547, Attn: Legal

    Changes to this Policy
    Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Policy changes on this page. We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amend terms on the Site. All amended terms shall automatically be effective thirty (30) days after they are initially posted on the Site. Each version of this Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective date.

    What Security Measures Do We Use?
    We seek to protect Personal Data using appropriate technical and organizational measures based on the type of Personal Data and applicable processing activity.

    We mainly use your Personal Information, either alone or in combination with other information, so that we can provide, enhance and personalize our Service and related content, products, and marketing efforts.

    The following are examples of a variety of ways that we may use your Personal Information. We may use your Personal Information:

    to provide you with the best user experience possible;
    to provide the products and services (e.g., rental Content) you purchase, respond to your questions, and carry out the transactions you have requested;
    to communicate with you regarding Service updates, offers, orders, alerts, promotions, and events;
    to help us develop, customize, deliver, support and improve our Service, products, content, and advertising;
    to help authenticate any account you create with us;
    to administer promotions and contests;
    to protect the rights or property of MLNP or our users, and prevent fraud and other prohibited or illegal activities;
    to protect the security of our products, services, and business;
    for our internal purposes (such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve our products, services, and communications); and
    otherwise, as disclosed to you at the point of collection.
    If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive communications from us, please follow any unsubscribe instructions that may be provided in our communications to you, or update your user preferences by logging into your user account on the Website. Please note that we may use your Personal Information to contact you with important notifications, such as notices with respect to purchases, safety, or changes to our terms, conditions, and policies; you may not opt out of these notifications.

    Social Features and Public Forums

    We offer user profiles, social features and privacy settings that enable you and other users of our Service to post Content, automatically share activity information (including rental histories), or otherwise communicate on the Service in a public way. The protections described in this Privacy Policy do not apply when you provide information, or adjust your user setting to provide information, about any person in connection with your use of these features. We may use your user name and other information about you to identify you with a posting in a public forum or with a social feature. Any information you share via a social feature or in a public forum is public information and may be seen or collected by other persons, including third parties that do not adhere to the standards set forth in this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for events arising from the distribution of any information you choose to publicly post or share through our Service. Please pay careful attention to your account privacy settings on the Service, which will impact what information about you is visible and may give you some control over what information is shared. If your user settings indicate that your profile is “visible”, your rental activity, social sharing activity, YES-ing activity, as well as your public profile information will be accessible to other users of the Service. If you do not want information about you shared in this way, adjust your settings so that your profile is only visible to yourself (in which case your user name will still be publicly available). If you are concerned with maintaining your privacy, we suggest that you choose a user name for the Service that does not reference your real name.

    Collection and Use of Non-Identifying Information

    We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose information in a form that does not personally identify you (“Non-Identifying Information“) for any purpose. Non-Identifying Information can include certain personally identifiable information that has been de-identified; that is, information that has been rendered anonymous. We and/or our third party service providers obtain Non-Identifying Information about you from information that you provide us, either separately or together with your Personal Information. We and/or our third party service providers also automatically collect certain Non-Identifying Information from you when you access our Service.

    Certain Non-Identifying Information about you would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers in a way that enables you to be identified. However, the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other Non-Identifying information. We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other users or sources to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of our products and services, and to analyze and understand how our products and services are used. We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically.

    Non-Identifying Information We Automatically Collect

    When you access our Service, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies, now and hereafter devised, that automatically record certain usage information. This information may include your Internet Protocol address (and other unique identifiers for the particular device you use to access the Internet), browser type, your web or application request, your interaction with our Service, the webpage or other feature you were using before you came to our Service, pages of our Website that you visit, information you search for via our Service, access times and dates, and other similar information. We use this information for a variety of purposes, including analyzing and enhancing our products and services, and to help personalize our Service for you. We do not treat this information as Personal Information (except to the extent required by local law), although if we combine it with the Personal Information you provide, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information. We and our third-party service providers may automatically collect Non-Identifying Information using various methods, including, without limitation, cookies.

    A cookie is a small data file transferred to your computer when it is used to access our Service. Cookies may be used for many purposes, including to enable certain features of our Service, to better understand how you interact with our Service and to monitor aggregate usage by visitors and online traffic routing. You may be able to instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the online services you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of our online services or all functionality of our online services.

    INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE

    Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we will not share your Personal Information with other companies or individuals outside of MLNP unless we have received your consent. Non-Identifying Information may be provided to third parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.

    Our Service Providers and Other Third Parties

    We may engage third party companies and individuals to perform services on our behalf (e.g., without limitation, payment processing, software maintenance services, e-mail notifications, product delivery services, database management, web analytics and other services). These third parties may have access to your Personal Information. If they do, this access is provided so that they may perform these tasks on our behalf and they are not authorized by us to otherwise use or disclose your Personal Information, except to the extent required by law.

    Compliance with Laws, Legal Process and Authorities

    We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of us or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical or legally actionable.

    Data Transfer

    MLNP processes personal information on our servers in the United States of America. Your Personal Information may be transferred to, and used by, entities located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. Such export is a requirement of providing your information to MLNP, and you hereby consent to such export in all respects.

    Business Transfers

    Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, we may sell, transfer or otherwise disclose some or all of our assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy. It’s MLNP’s practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.

    GENERAL

    Changing or Deleting Your Information

    MLNP makes good faith efforts to enable features on the Service that provide individuals with reasonable access to Personal Information that they have provided to MLNP for purposes of their user profiles and the reasonable ability to review and correct it or ask for deletion, as applicable, if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. To view and change Personal Information that you have directly provided to MLNP via the Service, you can log in to your user account on the Service, or contact MLNP via e-mail to curators@makelovenotporn.tv. Please note we may retain server/backup copies of all such data, and that we may decline to process change or deletion requests that we deem to be unreasonable, or require disproportionate technical effort, or jeopardize the privacy of others.

    Security

    We employ appropriate security measures to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These security measures include administrative, technical, and physical precautions to safeguard your Personal Information against loss, theft, and misuse. Please be advised, however, that while we strive to protect your Personal Information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and are not responsible for the theft, destruction or inadvertent disclosure of your personally identifiable information.

    Third Party Products and Services

    Our products and services may contain links to, or content from, third party websites and other products and services. The fact that we link to a website or display an advertisement or other third party content is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with any of those third parties, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices.

    We do not exercise control over third party websites, products or services. These other products and services may place their own cookies or other files on your computer or other device, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other persons and entities follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the information you submit to them or they collect from you. We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of those third parties.

    Changes to this Privacy Policy

    We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy. If we make changes, we will revise this Privacy Policy to reflect such changes and revise the effective date included at the end of this policy.

    The NewPipe project aims to provide a private, anonymous experience for using media web services.

    We provide some self-hosted services that help us develop NewPipe and the related projects, which require a minimum of personal data to be collected by us. We take your privacy seriously and process the data you provide only for the purposes described below. We promise to notify you about changes, as long as we are able to do so (i.e., we have a way to contact you, for example your e-mail address).

    We process and store data based on the EU General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 2016 in combination with the Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016) law as well as the German Bundesdatenschutzgesetz (short BDSG, a German federal data protection law) in its latest version.

    The following document fulfills the requirements of the GDPR Articles 13 and 14, and informs you about the collection and processing of personal data within our project.

    All data is stored in a German datacenter, and therefore the data is subject to German law as well as EU law.

    Person responsible
    The person responsible for the data collection described in this document is:

    Christian Schabesberger
    Dürerstr. 3
    91623 Sachsen b. A.
    chris.schabesberger@mailbox.org

    Data collection on the NewPipe website (including blog with comments and press kit)
    We do not collect any personal data of visitors of the NewPipe website. We do not install cookies on your system, and we do not track our users. Personal data such as the IP address are only processed for the purpose of serving the pages by our webserver software, and are deleted from the memory immediately after the page has been sent to the user.

    Server logs
    To have a minimum of control in scenarios where our website is abused, for example denial-of-service attacks, we configured our webserver to create a so-called acces log. This log file contains a list of all requests made to this server, each request in a separate line.

    The logged lines contain the following information:

    the IP address that was used to make the request
    a timestamp
    the URL
    the HTTP status code
    the user agent the user‘s browser sends automatically
    We need to keep logs of the IP addresses sending requests to our server. As IP addresses are considered personal data and we respect the privacy of our users, we only keep enough of the IP address to be able to able to react to abuse (e.g., DoS and other attacks).
    We calculate prefixes of the IP addresses to anonymize them as follows:

    For IPv4 addresses, we remove the last two bytes to anonymize them. For example, an IP address such as 12.34.56.78 would be logged as 12.34.0.0.
    For IPv6 addresses, we remove all bytes but the first two. For example, an IP address such as 2001:db8:85a3:8d3:1319:8a2e:370:7344 would be logged as 2001:db8:0:0:0:0:0:0 (short 2001:0db8::).
    We can not identify users from combinations of the other data. Therefore, we consider our log anonymized.

    Comments
    The NewPipe blog provides a comment section which can be used to provide feedback for the articles or the project itself. Normal visits don‘t yield any private data.

    Users have the ability to leave comments themselves. We use the excellent isso software to provide this feature.

    If a user sends a comment, the following data is collected:

    mandatory data:
    a name (can, but does not have to be a user's real name), allowing users to let others (including the NewPipe project) identify them, for example on other services, such as GitHub; the name is published next to the user's comment
    a personal comment
    optional data:
    an e-mail address, users can enter one if they want the NewPipe project to be able to contact them; it is not published and is not and won't ever be shared with third parties
    a URL to their homepage, which will be published publicly in the form of a link
    In order to fulfill legal constraints, i.e., to help investigating insults and similar criminal acts, we store the IP addresses that were used to create the comments. If we would not store them, we could be prosecuted ourselves.

    The IP addresses and the other data are stored permanently.

    In order to help users to comment more easily in the future, isso stores the contents of the name, e-mail address and URL fields of the comment form in the user's browser's localStorage. LocalStorage is a browser-side method for storing data persistently, and is bound to a single website. It has been standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), and has been published in form of a W3C Recommendation in 2016.

    LocalStorage behaves different than the well-known cookies. Unlike cookies, the localStorage's contents are never sent to our servers. We cannot change or copy them. They're only used by isso to fill them into the comment form on future visits. If you do not want isso to store anything in your localStorage, please configure your browser accordingly by either adding an exception for the NewPipe website, or deactivating localStorage completely. So-called "private modes" some browsers provide may also prevent localStorage from being created. Please refer to your browser's manual for details.

    Data collection and processing by Sentry, our bug report tracking system
    We maintain an instance of Sentry, a bug tracking and aggregation system, in order to process user-provided bug reports including crash logs and messages.

    We implemented a fully self-hosted bug reporting system that provides a unique level of transparency to the user. When NewPipe crashes on an Android device, the user is shown a dialog containing a summary of the information NewPipe was able to gain about the bug. The user can now opt to send the full details to the NewPipe project in order to allow us to identify and hopefully fix the bug. When a user clicks the send button, NewPipe composes an e-mail via the Android system (i.e., in the configured standard e-mail client) containing the details in a machine-readable format called JSON. JSON is a text-based format, allowing users to read the data and check exactly what data could be sent to us. Users can remove or anonymize data which they do not want to be shared, as long as the JSON format is not broken (in this case, our system can not parse the e-mail any more).

    The JSON part contains the following information:

    the e-mail address of the sender
    the type/name of the error
    the URL of the requested page that caused NewPipe to crash
    the language set in NewPipe's settings
    time of the incident (minute accuracy)
    name of the used application
    version of the used application
    operating system name, version and API level (e.g., Linux Android 4.4.4 - 19)
    the error protocol (stacktrace)
    Our bug reporting code is implemented to not embed any personal data in the JSON blob. However, we cannot guarantee that there won't be any personal data contained by accident. Also, we cannot control whether the user will add any personal data to the generated JSON data, nor can we control whether users add personal data outside it. Therefore we tried to implement our bug report system as transparently as possible, allowing the user to entirely control what data is sent. We assume that by sending an actual e-mail to the crash reporting system's address, any personal data is sent on behalf and with consent of the user. We preserve the right to process this data automatically in our Sentry system, the crash report importing software, and accompanying software. We store the data as long as it is needed for analyzations. The e-mails are stored on a self-hosted mail server, and won't be deleted before processing takes place. Often, the raw e-mail data is stored even longer, in order to allow re-imports of the data into Sentry.
    Any additional text in the e-mail that is not part of the JSON section is considered a user comment and will be processed and stored by us as well.

    Once the data has been imported, our Sentry system reorganizes the data. Bug reports which Sentry considers similar are aggregated. Sentry is configured to strip any personal data from the bug reports. This can be considered a "last line of defence", and doesn't ensure that no private data is ever collected and stored.

    Only a small circle of people has access to the Sentry system. We instruct every user to delete any report which contains personal data as soon as it is discovered. Due to the amount of bug reports we receive every day (varies from a few hundred to a few thousand e-mails every week), we can not check every report for personal data by hand. We ask you to ensure you don't send us any personal data you don't want to share with us. We consider any content in the e-mails to be sent with your consent. You may, at any time, request deletion of the data. Please see below for your rights as a user.

    Once an issue discovered by Sentry has been resolved, the reports related to it are archived in the database.

    Users' rights
    Every user has the right to request details about the personal data stored about them according to GDPR Art. 15.

    Every user has the right to request the correction or completion (GDPR Art. 16) or deletion (GDPR Art. 17) or restriction of use (GDPR Art. 18) of the data sent to us at any time.

    In many cases, due to our philosophy, the data is highly anonymized. If your data is, and we think it should be, anonymized so that we cannot associate with any user, we can most likely not delete it from our system. In these cases, however, no personal data is collected. Furthermore, if we cannot verify your identity (e.g., you use another e-mail address to request the deletion of data associated with another e-mail address), we can not delete the data from our systems either.

    According to GDPR Art. 77, you may, at any time, file a complaint about our data processing at your local data protection officer.

    According to GDPR Art. 7 paragraph 3, you may revoke any consent you gave us about storing and processing data at any time for future time.

    According to GDPR Art. 21, you may at any time dissent the processing and storing of data listed in the article.

    Note on Data Security
    All data is stored on a dedicated server administrated by the NewPipe project. Neither the hosting provider nor any other third party does have any access to the data, as it is stored encryptedly on the hard disks using so-called full-disk encryption.

    Note on Backups
    On a regular basis, backups of the data are created, and stored encryptedly on the server. After encrypting them, they are stored in different locations in Germany in order to create some redundancy, and allowing restoration in case of failures. The backups are stored up to 6 months, and are then deleted securely from the systems. The encrypted backups are stored as-is on the backup system the hosting provider provides. On systems outside the data center, they are stored with the same full-disk encryption mechanisms that are used to prevent unauthorized access to the raw data on the original server.

    Note on Abuse
    The data is processed and stored only for the purposes described above. We will not share any of the data with third parties. The published data is available on the Internet publicly, so that we can not tell whether third parties will copy them unauthorizedly. We want to state that we do not authorize any of these uses. If we should be informed about any unauthorized and illegal uses of our data, we will take appropriate measures to prevent further abuse. We encourage our users to actively help us with this by contacting the person responsible listed in this document immediately. If you wish to, you can use PGP encryption to make sure your message can not be read by anybody but you and the NewPipe team. The PGP key's ID and fingerprint can be found below the details of the person responsible.",

    object to the processing of personal data at any time. We will then no longer process personal data for the purpose of direct marketing or any related profiling.

    We also do not process your personal data for other purposes after an objection, unless we can provide compelling reasons worthy of protection for the processing, which outweigh your interests, rights, and freedoms or if the processing serves the assertion, exertion or defense of legal claims (cf. Art. 21 para. 1 DSGVO, so-called “restricted right of objection”). In this case, you must state the grounds for your objection which result from your specific situation.

    You can also object the processing of your personal data for reasons that arise from your specific situation, after they had been processed for scientific or historical research purposes or for statistical purposes in accordance with art. 89 para. 1 DSGVO, unless the processing is necessary for performing a task in the public interest (cf. Art. 21 para. 6 DSGVO).

    In the individual sections, we will also point out the right of objection to you separately (e.g. by using the note: “You have the right of objection”) if this right exists. There, you will also find further information on how to exercise your right of objection.

    In order to keep the following privacy policy clear, we refer to information and data privacy statements on external websites in various places by using links (cf. section “Social Networks & External Links” in this privacy policy).

Google Analytics may also use so-called web beacons (invisible graphics). Via these web beacons, information such as the visitor traffic on a website can be evaluated. The information about the usage of our website (including the IP address of the users) generated by cookies and web beacons are transmitted to and stored by a Google server that might be located in the USA or other third countries.

The information generated by cookies and web beacons about the usage of our website (including your IP address) and the delivery of advertising formats will be transmitted to and stored by a Google server that might be located in the USA or other third countries.

    Information on Google’s existing Privacy Shield certification and other relevant data relating to Google’s processing of data in the scope of using Google services can be found in this privacy policy under paragraph “6) Information about Google services”.

    Through the integration of Google AdSense, we pursue the purpose of being able to offer you interest-based advertisements, and to be able to finance our offer through the successful use of advertising media. For this, we are using the option “contextual-only advertisements” from Google AdSense. This means that Google will broadcast advertisements based on the content of our website and not on the interest profile created by you. Therefore, an analysis of your data for the purpose of profiling does not take place here. However, Google also uses cookies and web beacons in the scope of the “contextual-only advertisements” to prevent abuse, compile statistics, and prevent multiple visits.

    For this purpose, reCAPTCHA (No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA) displays a clickable checkbox “I’m not a robot” to you. To do so, reCAPTCHA analyzes the behavior of a user as soon as they visit the website based on different characteristics.

    This document informs Users about the technologies that help this Website to achieve the purposes described below. Such technologies allow the Owner to access and store information (for example by using a Cookie) or use resources (for example by running a script) on a User’s device as they interact with this Website.

    For simplicity, all such technologies are defined as Trackers within this document – unless there is a reason to differentiate.
    For example, while Cookies can be used on both web and mobile browsers, it would be inaccurate to talk about Cookies in the context of mobile apps as they are a browser-based Tracker. For this reason, within this document, the term Cookies is only used where it is specifically meant to indicate that particular type of Tracker.

    Some of the purposes for which Trackers are used may also require the User's consent, depending on the applicable law. Whenever consent is given, it can be freely withdrawn at any time following the instructions provided in this document.

    This Website uses Trackers managed directly by the Owner (so-called “first-party” Trackers) and Trackers that enable services provided by a third-party (so-called “third-party” Trackers). Unless otherwise specified within this document, third-party providers may access the Trackers managed by them.
    The validity and expiration periods of Cookies and other similar Trackers may vary depending on the lifetime set by the Owner or the relevant provider. Some of them expire upon termination of the User’s browsing session.
    In addition to what’s specified in the descriptions within each of the categories below, Users may find more precise and updated information regarding lifetime specification as well as any other relevant information — such as the presence of other Trackers — in the linked privacy policies of the respective third-party providers or by contacting the Owner.

    California Online Privacy Protection Act

    CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy.

    Our company respects your privacy, and we understand the importance of the information you entrust to us. This Privacy Policy describes our practices concerning the information we collect from you when you visit our website and utilize the service we offer.

    This policy describes: (i) The types of information we collect when you use our service; (ii) How we use, share, and protect that information; (iii) How long we retain that information; and (iv) Your rights and options regarding the information we collect.

    By visiting this website or using our service, you consent to our collection and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. Therefore, we suggest that you read it, and to contact us if you have any questions.

    Information We Collect. We collect two different classes of information from you.

    The first is Personally Identifiable Information (PII) which pertains to you as an individual. We will collect PII from you only if you choose to complete the form in order to receive information about continuing your education. As of this date, we collect the following information when you complete a form on our site:

    Your full name and date of birth;
    Street and email address,
    Phone number; and
    Specific data pertaining to educational background and goals.
    In addition, when you visit our website, we will record your computer IP address or mobile device number and may tie it to the data submitted with the form. Under ordinary circumstances, an IP address or mobile device number recorded in isolation is not PII under the standard definition of the term. However, it may become PII when it is combined with other information, as in this case.

    The second class of information we collect is called General Information, which consists of information that is anonymous in nature and does not identify you as an individual. General Information of this nature is collected through a small piece of computer code called a “cookie,” and includes your computer IP address, unique mobile device identifier, browser type, ISP or carrier name, the URL of the last webpage you visited before visiting our website, and actions you undertake on our site whenever you visit. This information gives us insights on how our users use our site and our services.

    How We Use Information. If you meet the initial qualifications as determined by your answers to the questions presented on the form, we will share your PII with participating schools and educational service providers so they may provide you with information regarding the programs they offer.

    If you express an interest in any of the offers presented to you after you complete form, we may use your PII to connect you with the third party that sponsors the offer(s) in which you expressed an interest. We may also use your PII for the following purposes:

    To send you email messages with information that we believe may be of interest to you, including offers for third party products and services;
    For internal business purposes, such as market research, site analysis, etc.; and
    To comply with applicable legal requirements, protect our legal rights, and to enforce our Terms of Service
    We use the information we collect through cookies to improve our site’s features, to customize your visits, to determine which of our site’s pages you access, to narrow or limit the advertising materials provided to you based on your prior online activities. Note that we may also choose to anonymize certain elements of the PII you provide to us so that it can no longer be attributed to you. We will use PII that we render anonymous in the same manner as we use General Information.

    How We Share Information. We share PII and General Information as follows:

    Participating Schools and Educational Service Providers: We share your PII with participating schools and educational service providers and parties related to the college admissions process. It is important to note that these parties are not affiliated with us and may use your information in accordance with their own privacy policies, which we encourage you to review.
    Employees and Contractors: We share your PII with those employees and contractors that must have access to it in order to perform their functions.
    Service Providers: As of the effective date of this policy, any PII we share with service providers is encrypted and inaccessible. We share General Information with nonaffiliated third parties that perform services or functions on our behalf, including cloud storage and web hosting providers, email service providers, and software maintenance service providers. We must necessarily share information with such third parties as may be required to perform their functions, but only to the extent necessary for them to do so.
    Legal Requests: If requested or required by law enforcement authorities, courts, or regulators, we may disclose any information we have collected from you. We also may disclose your information to exercise or protect our legal rights or to defend against legal claims.
    Other: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these business transfers, customer information is typically one of the business assets that are transferred. Moreover, if all or substantially all of our business assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that we go out of business or enter into bankruptcy, customer information (including your PII), would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any assets may continue to be used as set forth in this policy.
    How We Protect Information. We take the security of your information seriously and use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect PII against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage. Our website and the server(s) upon which our data is stored is hosted using 256-bit Secure Socket Layering (SSL) to encrypt all elements of PII. This website also uses a generally accepted standard of technological security for the purpose of protecting all information provided by visitors from misuse, loss, or corruption. We also limit access to PII to those employees and contractors who reasonably need access to it to deliver our service.

    How Long We Keep Information. We reserve the right to retain your information for as long as we deem necessary to fulfill a business purpose or comply with a legal request, and may anonymize certain of the information you provide to us so that it can no longer be attributed to you if we would like to retain it for longer periods of time.

    Your Rights and Control. You may limit how we use your PII as follows: (i) You may elect not to have a unique cookie identification number assigned to your computer to avoid aggregation and analysis of data collected on our Site by configuring your browser; and (ii) You may stop receiving commercial emails from us by clicking the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of the email (this will not prevent or interfere with us sending you non-marketing transactional communications). Residents of certain states, such as California, have additional rights as described below.

    For Residents of Certain States. If you reside in a state such as California that has adopted a comprehensive consumer privacy law (a “Privacy Law State”), you may have some or all of the following rights regarding the PII we collect from and about you under the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) and similar laws adopted by other Privacy Law States:

    Right to Ask: The right to ask us: (1) whether we are collecting, selling, or disclosing your PII; and (2) to identify the categories of PII we collected from and about you;
    Right to Access: The right to access the PII we collected from you;
    Right to Deletion: The right to have your PII deleted without undue delay in certain circumstances;
    Right to Restriction: The right to restrict the sharing or sale of your PII for business purposes in certain circumstances.
    Right to Opt-Out: You have the right to opt-out of the sale of your PII; and
    Right to Non-Discriminatory Treatment: You have the right not to be discriminated against for exercising any of the rights listed above.
    If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact our Privacy Officer via email at . We will honor the requests you make related to your rights as the law allows, which means, in some cases, there may be legal or other legitimate reasons that we may not be able to address the specific request you make. You do not have to pay any fees to exercise your rights. We will respond to your request within 45 days. We will verify your request using the information associated with your account or other information that is held by us, including your email address.

    You may also designate an authorized agent to exercise your Privacy Law State rights on your behalf. In order to allow an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf, please email us at support@banneredgemedia.com to provide your written request and consent to an authorized agent. When your authorized agent makes a request related to your personal information, we will require the agent to provide the above written permission. We may also require that you verify your own identity directly with us at the time such a request is made.

    In addition, under the California Online Privacy Protection Act, California residents may request information regarding the types of PII we share with third parties for direct marketing purposes, and the identities of the third parties with whom we have shared such information during the immediately preceding calendar year. You may request further information about our compliance with this law by contacting our privacy officer at privacy@banneredgemedia.com. Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year concerning this law, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through the means described above.

    Tracking Technology and Do-Not-Track Requests. We do not currently employ any technology that enables us to track your online activities over time and across third-party Web sites. Because we do not employ tracking technology, we offer no response to Do-Not-Track requests transmitted by Web browsers.

    Third-Party Links. Our Site may display offers for goods and services sponsored by third parties after the Education Evaluation form is submitted, which may include links to other websites operated by the sponsor of the offer. We are not associated with any of these third parties. If you choose to provide any information to any of these third parties, the collection and disclosure of your information by that entity will be governed solely by that party's privacy policy. We make no representations or warranties regarding any of these offers or sites.

    Consumer Privacy & Third-Party Cookies. Notwithstanding anything else in this policy, we and/or our partners may place or read use IP and/or cookies to enable you to receive personalized ads or content. These cookies contain zero personally identifiable information. The cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us on our network, e.g., your email address, which we may share with a data provider solely in hashed, non-human readable form. Users may also express their choices for display advertising, through the following platforms: Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out platform or the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out platform. We and/or our partners use IP and/or cookies and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about you, such as your Internet Protocol address and certain online behaviors, such as opening emails or browsing websites or interacting with apps. Such information is used to personalize ads or content and may be shared with our network partners.

    We and/or our network partners may also use IP and/or cookies for delivering personalized advertising emails. These IPs and/or cookies are used to identify the visitors of our advertisers' websites and for the advertiser to send personalized emails based on the visitors' browsing experience on the advertiser's site/app. To opt out, go to https://www.degreelocate.com/unsubscribe.php

    Children under 18. Our service is not intended for users under the age of 18, and we do not knowingly collect any information from children under 18. If we are informed that you have provided us with the information of anyone under the age of 18 in a manner that violates any statute or regulation concerning the same, we will attempt to delete it as soon as possible.

    Changes to this Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to amend, alter, or otherwise change this Privacy Policy at our sole and absolute discretion. If we make any changes regarding the disclosure of Personal Information to third parties, we will inform you via email or by posting a notice on our Site.

    7. Cookies and web tracking
    7.1. Definition of cookies and other technologies
    We use cookies to automatically collect data. Our website may contain cookies set by us or by third parties. A cookie is a text file containing a small amount of data. A website can send it to your browser, and it is then stored on your device as an anonymous tag that identifies your device. Some of the pages on our website use cookies in order to be able to offer you better services when you return. The data therefore stored and transferred in our cookies can be found in the cookies list.

    In addition, we use web beacons, which are also known as 1×1 GIFs, clear GIFs or tags. Web beacons are tiny graphic images that may be embedded in our website. Web beacons allow us to optimise our products and services and to supply third-party partners with analysis data, e.g. how many users visit our website. We may also use web beacons in our email correspondence to determine whether you have opened an email or taken other actions. We also cooperate with other organisations and place our web beacons on their websites or advertisements. The aim of this is to derive statistics as to the number of times a visitor who clicks on an advertisement on a website of Meister GmbH or of an advertising partner actually follows up with a purchase or with some other interaction on the website of an advertising partner.

    We use device IDs (“IDs”) to automatically collect data for our apps. An ID is a unique sequence of numbers and letters (“string”) that is associated with your device but does not identify you. The ID allows us and selected third parties to understand your behaviour when you use the app. Almost all apps use the ID technology. IDs have various purposes: For instance, they remember your preferences and generally improve your user experience; they tell us whether you have used our app before or whether it is your first visit; they ensure that the advertisements you see on our app are tailored to your interests. Consequently, IDs are extremely useful in improving your user experience.

    7.2. Necessary cookies
    Insofar as we use cookies and other tracking tools to provide our website and its basic functions (system cookies) and to store our cookie settings and login data, the legal base for the use of necessary cookies is § 25 sec 2 no. 2 TDDDG. 

    7.3. Other cookies
    Provided that you have given us your consent to use cookies and other tracking tools (according to Art. 6 Sec. 1 lit. a GDPR and § 25 Sec. 1 TDDDG), we use them for targeting, profiling and advertising, to personalise our offers and display personalised advertisements, as well as for anonymised analyses of website use (“web statistics”), so that we can continue to improve our offers and better align them with the needs and interests of the website visitors.

    7.4. Web analytics using Google (Universal) Analytics
    We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, 4 Barrow St, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Irland (“Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies, which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how users use the site. We process your personal data on the basis of your given consent (Art. 6 sec. 1 lit a GDPR). The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address, sessions statistics, approx. geo-location, browser information and device type) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google acts as our processor. The cookies used for this purpose expire after 24 months.

    Our websites use an IP anonymization feature provided by Google Analytics. Your IP address will therefore be truncated/anonymized by Google as soon as it receives it. On our behalf, Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage to us.

    9.2. Online advertising and remarketing
    We are using various cookie-based online advertising tools to offer our website users a more personalized and engaged web experience by offering advertisements on the respective social media channels that are more relevant to them. 

    Google Analytics Remarketing: Our websites and our services use the features of Google Analytics Remarketing combined with the cross-device capabilities of Google Ads and DoubleClick. This service is provided by Google. This feature makes it possible to link target audiences for promotional marketing created with Google Analytics Remarketing to the cross-device capabilities of Google Ads and Google DoubleClick. This allows advertising to be displayed based on your personal interests, identified based on your previous usage and surfing behaviour on one device (e.g. your mobile phone), on other devices (such as a tablet or computer). Once you have given your consent, Google will associate your web and app browsing history with your Google Account for this purpose. That way, any device that signs in to your Google Account can use the same personalized promotional messaging. To support this feature, Google Analytics collects Google-authenticated IDs of users that are temporarily linked to our Google Analytics data to define and create audiences for cross-device ad promotion. 

    We process your personal data like session statistics, approx. geo-location, browser information and device type on the basis of your given consent (Art. 6 sec. 1 lit. a GDPR). You can permanently opt out of cross-device remarketing/targeting by turning off personalized advertising in your Google Account; follow this link: https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/ . 

    GoogleAds and Google Conversion Tracking: We use Google Ads which is an online advertising program of Google. In the context of Google Ads we use the so-called conversion tracking. When you click on an ad placed by Google, a cookie will be set for the conversion tracking. Information about cookie lifespan can be found here. If the user visits certain pages of this website and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and we can recognize that the user has clicked on the ad and has been redirected to this page. Each Google Ads customer gets a different cookie. The cookies can not be tracked over websites of Ads customers. The information collected using the conversion cookie is used to generate conversion statistics for Ads customers who have chosen for Conversion Tracking. Customers see the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a page with a conversion tracking tag. However, we will not receive any information that can be used to identify users. 

    We process your personal data on the basis of your given consent (Art. 6 sec. 1 lit. a GDPR). You can permanently opt out of cross-device remarketing/targeting by turning off personalized advertising in your Google Account; follow this link: https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/ . 

    Facebook Ads: We use Facebook Ads (Facebook Pixel & Facebook Custom Audience) provided by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited (formerly Facebook), 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland (“Facebook”). We integrate snippets of code provided by Facebook that load a small library of functions (sometimes referred to as “tracking pixels”, i.e. transparent, pixel-sized images embedded in websites with a tracking functionality). These functions enable us to track your activities on our website, such as URLs visited, domains visited, device(s) used, and, in particular advertising conversions (i.e. actions counted when you interact with one of our ads, such as clicking it and purchasing our product afterwards). Furthermore, we process your personal data like IP address, browser information, page location, document referrer, pixel-specific data (pixel ID, Facebook Cookie). The functions rely on cookies placed by Facebook, which may also enable us to match our website visitors to respective user accounts on the respective social media platform. We may also use the “Custom Audience” service provided by Facebook for delivering targeted advertising to you. In this context, we would check whether you hold an account with Facebook for which you use the same email-address that you have provided to us and include you in a corresponding “custom audience” group. This works by us providing your email-address to Facebook in a hashed format, and this way making sure that Facebook will only process, as a data processor on our behalf, actual email-addresses of users that have already subscribed to their service (further information on this process can be found here).

    We process your personal data on the basis of your given consent (Art. 6 sec. 1 lit. a GDPR). You can revoke your consent. You may also opt-out of receiving targeted ads because you are part of a custom audience created by MeisterLabs through clicking a corresponding link when you select the “Why am I seeing this?” feature on the Facebook platform (see here)).

    F. YOUR RIGHTS
    1. Right to withdraw consent
    Insofar as we process your data on the basis of your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.

    You have the right to obtain confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning you are being processed. Where that is the case, you have the right of access to these data; in particular, regarding the purpose of processing, the categories of personal data concerned, the recipients, the period for which the personal data will be stored, the source of the data, your rights with regard to these data, as well as, where personal data are transferred to a third country, the appropriate safeguards pursuant to Article 46 GDPR.

    5. Right to restriction of processing
    In certain cases, you have the right to obtain restriction of processing of your personal data (without erasure). In consequence, we will continue to store these data, but will only process them with your consent, for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person, or for reasons of important public interest of the Union or of a Member State.

    You have the right to obtain restriction of processing if: 

    you contest the accuracy of the personal data, for a period enabling us to verify the accuracy of the personal data;

    you have objected to the processing of your data pending the verification whether legitimate grounds for processing prevail;

    the processing is unlawful, but you oppose the erasure of the personal data;

You only have this right if we process these data on the basis of our legitimate interests.

    Moreover, you have the right to object if you receive direct marketing from us and no longer wish to receive this in the future. In this case, we will no longer process your personal data for these purposes.

    7. Right to data portability
    If the processing of your data is based on your consent or on a contract you entered into with us and the processing is carried out by automated means, you have the right to receive the personal data provided by you in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. You also have the right to have the personal data transmitted directly from us to another controller, where technically feasible.

    Last Modified: March 5, 2024
    Effective: March 20, 2024

    Privacy policies aren’t known for being the most entertaining reading material on the world wide web, however, they are important; increasingly so in a world driven by data. Here at YNAB, we love to entertain, but we take your privacy seriously. Being entrusted with your personal information is a privilege, and a responsibility that we don’t take lightly.

    Similar to how feeling in control of your money can bring great peace of mind, that same philosophy applies to your personal information. That’s why our intent is to make YNAB’s Privacy Policy as clear and as easy to understand as possible. You should read this entire Privacy Policy, but here are our key points:

    ✓ Our money comes from you, not ads in our service. As a consumer-focused subscription business, we rely on your subscriptions to offer our Services**.**

    ✓ Generally, we use the information we collect about you to correspond with you, perform our agreements with you, carry out marketing and advertising activities, and perform our day-to-day business activities and operations.

    ✓ We do not sell your Financial Data or any other information you provide through the Product (as both terms are defined below); we do perform typical targeted advertising in an effort to introduce more people to the many benefits of YNAB.

    ✓ We honor your requests to exercise your privacy rights; just let us know how we can help - whether accessing or deleting your data or otherwise.

    ✓ We talk a lot about the importance of trusting your budget, and that goes beyond knowing that the calculations are correct. Your Financial Data is private and we help you keep it that way. The rest of this is a legal document, and it reads like a legal document. (That's what our lawyers want us to do.) We've included a table of contents here, and summaries at the top of most sections in an effort to make it easier to understand, but it’s critical that you read the entire document.

    Overview
    This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) describes the data protection practices of You Need A Budget LLC and its affiliates ( “YNAB,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). The Policy applies to our websites and applications that link to this Policy, including our budgeting apps and products (“Product”) and the YNAB.com website, as well as related online and offline services thereto, and any services, transactions, or engagement you might have with us (collectively, the “Services”). 

    We may change this Policy from time to time. We will make the revised Policy accessible through the Services, so you should review the Policy periodically. You can know if the Policy has changed since the last time you reviewed it by checking the “Last Modified” date at the top of this Policy. If we make a material change to this Policy, we will provide you with notice in accordance with legal requirements. By continuing to use the Services, you are confirming that you have read and understood the latest version of this Policy.

    If you have any questions or concerns about this Policy, please contact us at privacy@ynab.com.

    1. Collection, Use, and Disclosure of Information
    Summary: The information collected as you correspond with us or use the Services is used for the following purposes: to contact you, to fulfill our agreements with you, and to perform routine business activities and operations, including marketing. The following sections offer details about the types of information collected, how and why we collect, protect, use, and disclose that information, and, for users in the UK and European Economic Area, our legal bases for processing it.

    Categories of Information We Collect
    We collect information about you, including information that directly or indirectly identifies you, through your use of YNAB. We do so:

    When you provide the information, by filling out forms or otherwise providing information through the Services;
    When you create or add to your budgets and budget categories or we connect to your financial institutions in order to retrieve financial transaction data on your behalf or you provide other financial transaction data within the Product (collectively “Financial Data”);
    When you use location services to record transactions;
    Automatically (through cookies and similar tools) when you browse our websites and apps or interact with our marketing communications; 
    Attend events or participate in programs; and
    When you correspond with us to receive customer support via email or chat.
    This includes:

    Information that you provide by filling in forms on the Services, including  information provided at the time of registering to use or subscribing to use paid aspects of the Services  (e.g., email address), requesting further services, entering a contest or promotion we sponsor, completing surveys, or otherwise contacting us. When you use an identity provider – such as Google – to login to our services, we also receive the email associated with the Google (or similar) account. And if you use the Services as part of a Plan (as defined below), we may collect information associated with your use of the Plan (e.g., work email address and the date you joined the plan).   
    Your IP address when you interact with the Services.
    Your address (including postal code) for billing purposes.
    When you choose to directly link financial accounts to YNAB, we receive certain information about those financial accounts, including account balances, transactions and holdings.
    Your location when you record a transaction via the Services, including general and precise location (in accordance with your device settings and location permissions).  Precise location, if enabled, helps the Services remember the location where you are when you record a transaction, so that the Services may suggest that payee when you record another transaction near that same location in the future. General location information means information to identify the city and state in which your device is located based on its IP address. YNAB does not use precise or general geolocation information to show you promotions or advertisements based on your location. Please note that precise geolocation information is considered sensitive personal information under certain privacy laws, and we process this information in accordance with applicable legal requirements. You can disable precise geolocation tracking on your device. 
    Your communications with us (including email addresses different than that used to establish your account), if you contact us.
    Details of transactions you carry out through the Services, such as records of when you purchase a subscription to YNAB. You may be required to provide billing information before placing an order through the Services.
    To provide you with customer support or service offerings, including responding to and resolving your inquiries and requests via email or text-based chat. When you request assistance from our customer support team with respect to importing third-party financial account data, to allow a customer support representative to review a limited amount of data from your accounts, including account names and recent transactions for the sole purpose of facilitating technical implementation of the account aggregation services. When asked to do so by you, our customer support representative may utilize that transaction data on your behalf in interactions with third-party financial account providers intended to facilitate implementation of requested account aggregation within our services.
    Technical and usage information when you use the Services or interact with our marketing communications. This information includes IP address, geographic location of the device, browser type, browser language, date and time of your request, time(s) of your visit(s), error logs and other system activity, online browsing behavior data, and other information that allows us to analyze how the Services are used. 
    In some cases, we will tell you when we need to collect certain information to provide you with certain services (for example, we may need certain information to access your YNAB budget so our support team can help you troubleshoot an issue). If you choose not to provide such information, we may not be able to provide the services you have requested.

    Sources of Information
    We collect most of the information referred to above from you directly. However, we may also collect information about you from the following third-party sources:

    Bank data vendors, such as open banking service providers and bank aggregation service providers, which provide access to certain information about your financial accounts. YNAB will obtain your consent before collecting information from these providers;
    Other users of the Services, for instance in relation to YNAB Together or a referral program;
    Advertising networks and partners;
    Analytics providers; and
    Social media sites.
    Cookies, Online Analytics, and Advertising
    We may use third-party analytics services (such as Amplitude and Google Analytics) as well as self-hosted data collection services on our Services to collect and analyze usage information through cookies and similar tools (such as the pages most read, time spent, search terms and other engagement data); engage in auditing, research, or reporting; assist with fraud prevention; and provide certain features to you. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by clicking here. 

    Usage information of our Services is collected to compile statistical data in order to develop new and improved Services and marketing, identify popular features, and to provide you content that is of interest to you.

    If you receive email from us, we may use certain analytics tools, such as tracking pixels, to capture data such as when you open our message or click on any links or banners our email contains. This data allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications and marketing campaigns.

    We also partner with third-party advertisers, ad server companies, and ad networks to promote our service. If you respond to one of our advertisements and visit or register to use our Services, we or our service providers may provide these third-party advertising companies with identifiers from your device or computer, such as an IP address or device ID, to help us analyze our user acquisition efforts.

    The use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on devices you use to access our Services by non-affiliated third parties is governed by those third parties' privacy policies. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your devices to deliver tailored advertising, please read our Cookies Policy.

    We may combine the information collected through cookies with other information we collect about you.

    Legal Bases for Use of Your Information
    The laws of some jurisdictions, including the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and the United Kingdom (“UK”), require that companies only process your “Personal Data” (as that term is defined in the applicable law, like the EU General Data Protection Regulation) if they have a “legal basis” (or justifiable need) for processing your Personal Data. To the extent those laws apply, our legal bases for processing Personal Data are as follows: 

    To perform our obligations pursuant to a contract (or pending contract) with you. For example, we will process your Personal Data to comply with the YNAB Terms of Service as part of entering into a contract with you, and to honor our commitments in any contracts that we have with you.
    For our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others. For example, we will process your Personal Data to: operate our business and our Services; identify and fix any issues with our Services; provide customer service; secure the Services; learn more about how our customers use the Services; perform internal analytics; improve the Services and users’ experiences; conduct marketing; provide you with certain information about new products, special offers or other information that we think you may find interesting using the email address which you have provided in accordance with applicable law; make and receive payments; comply with legal requirements and defend our legal rights; prevent fraud; engage in a business change (e.g., sale, merger); and to know the customer to whom we are providing Services.
    To comply with our legal obligations, such as our obligation to share data with tax authorities.
    With your consent. Where we rely on this basis, you may have the right to withdraw your consent at any time as described below.
    Disclosure of Information
    We disclose data to fulfill the purposes for which you provide it; to enforce or apply our Terms of Service, including billing. We may disclose or transfer information that we collect or you provide with:

    Service Providers. These parties help us provide the Services or perform business functions on our behalf. They include: 

    Hosting, technology and communication providers.

    Security and fraud prevention consultants.

    Support and customer service vendors.

    Advertising Partners. These parties help us market our service. They include ad networks and other marketing providers. 

    Analytics Partners. These parties provide analytics on web traffic or usage of the Services. They include Companies that track how users found or were referred to the Services and Companies that track how users interact with the Services.

    Our Payment and Subscription Processors, which at this time are Stripe and Recurly, to process and manage your payment for the Services.

    Financial Data Aggregation Services, but only with your consent. By utilizing these services, you acknowledge that the terms of the respective privacy policies of these providers (MX, Plaid, TrueLayer, etc.) will apply to your use of their services. With respect to aggregating your banking and other financial accounts, you or we (with your consent) will transmit your account credentials to third-party financial data aggregation services, who will use them to link, gather and maintain your account balances, transactions, and holdings used to provide the Services.

    A buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution or other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding, in which personal information held by us about users of the Services is among the assets transferred.

    Other users you authorize. For example, when you use YNAB Together, you authorize us to share budgets that you own and data encompassed within those budgets with your Group Manager and selected Members of your YNAB Together Group.  Members of your YNAB Together Group may view certain information about you, including budgets that you own or have access to, your first name, and email address. For more information about YNAB Together and these defined terms, visit our Help Doc. 

    YNAB Partner. If you elect to participate in the Product through a business or other organization (“Partner”) as part of a Partner’s plan (“Plan”), for example, when an employer provides YNAB as an employee benefit, then we will share certain of information—such as name, email address, and the date you joined the Services—with that Partner. If a Plan has 10 or more users, we may also provide the Partner with aggregated, anonymized data about the number of Plan users who access YNAB each month and how users are interacting with the Services.

    We may also disclose your information:

    To comply with any court order, law or legal process, including to respond to any government or regulatory request.
    To enforce or apply our Terms of Service or terms of sale and other agreements, including for billing and collection purposes.
    If we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of YNAB, our customers or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
    To fulfill the purpose for which you provide it.
    For any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information.
    With your consent.
    Deidentified and Aggregated Data
    We may de-identify and aggregate information collected in such a way that the information cannot reasonably be linked to you or your device. We may use such de-identified or aggregated data for any purposes (including testing our IT systems, research, data analysis, improving the Services, and developing new products and features) and may disclose it to our service providers. Also, when we de-identify and aggregate non-Financial Data, we may disclose such data to any third parties, including advertisers, promotional partners, and others.

    2. Data Retention
    Generally speaking, we retain your information as necessary to provide the Services and to fulfill the transactions you have requested, and for other necessary purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, enforcing our agreements, and for fraud prevention and related security purposes. In determining how long to retain information, we consider the nature and sensitivity of the information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the information, the purposes for which we process the information, how long an account has been inactive, and applicable legal requirements.

    More specifically: 

    We retain account data for up to 12 months after your subscription or trial expires, unless you delete your account as described below.
    After deletion, we may retain your email address to be able to confirm deletion of associated data.
    Notwithstanding the above, we may retain information as long as necessary to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations or in connection with any legal proceedings. 
    Note that you can request deletion of your information at any time by following the steps in the Your Rights and Choices section of this Policy.

    3. Third-Party Applications and Integrations
    When you choose to use third-party apps (such as the YNAB Toolkit or other OAuth apps based on our API), plug-ins, or websites that integrate with the Services, they may receive your information and content, including your personal data, photos, and your activity data. Information collected by these third parties is subject to their terms and policies. YNAB is not responsible for the terms or policies of third parties, so we urge you to review their privacy and security policies prior to use.

    4. Children's Privacy
    The Services are not intended for children under 13 years of age or 16 years of age for those who habitually reside in the European Economic Area or United Kingdom. No one under these ages may provide any personal data to the Services. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 13. If you are under 13 or 16, do not use or provide any information on the Services or through any of its features, register for the Services, make any purchases through the Services, or provide any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address or any screen name or user name you may use. If we learn we have collected or received personal data from a child under 13 or 16, we will delete that information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 13 or 16, please contact us at privacy@ynab.com.

    5. Your Rights and Choices
    Summary: All users have certain rights, for instance in relation to marketing communications and interactions on their mobile devices. Depending on your jurisdiction, you may also have the right to make certain requests regarding your personal information, including the ability to access, correct, or delete certain personal information and to opt-out of certain uses of your personal information. Those rights are outlined below, including information about how to exercise those rights. If there’s any conflict between this section and other areas of this Policy, the portion that protects your personal information the most will be followed. If you are a resident of California, please see our California Privacy Policy for additional disclosures about our practices and more information about your rights.

    Rights Regarding Your Information.
    Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to make certain requests regarding your “personal information” or “personal data” (as such terms are defined under applicable law, and collectively referred to herein as “personal information”). Specifically, you may have the right to ask us to:

    Inform you about the categories of personal information we collect or disclose about you; the categories of sources of such information; the business or commercial purpose for collecting your personal information; and the categories of third parties with whom we disclose personal information.
    Provide you access to and/or a copy of certain personal information we hold about you.
    Correct or update personal information we hold about you.
    Delete certain personal information we have about you.
    Provide you with information about the financial incentives that we offer to you, if any.
    As provided in applicable law, you also have the right to not be discriminated against for exercising your rights. 

    You may also have the right to opt out of “sales” of your information and “sharing/processing of your information for targeted advertising” as described below.  If you are a California resident, please see our California Privacy Policy for more information about our privacy practices and your rights.

    Please note that certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. For example, we need to retain certain information in order to provide our services to you. We also need to take reasonable steps to verify your identity before responding to a request, which may include, at a minimum, depending on the sensitivity of the information you are requesting and the type of request you are making, verifying your name and email address. Depending on your jurisdiction, you may be permitted to designate an authorized agent to submit certain requests on your behalf. In order for an authorized agent to be verified, you must provide the authorized agent with signed, written permission to make such requests or a power of attorney. We may also follow up with you to verify your identity before processing the authorized agent’s request. If you would like further information regarding your legal rights or would like to exercise any of them, please visit this link or email us at: privacy@ynab.com.

    You may also authorize an agent (an “Authorized Agent”) to exercise your rights on your behalf. To do this, you must provide your Authorized Agent with written permission to exercise your rights on your behalf, and we may request a copy of this written permission from your Authorized Agent when they make a request on your behalf.

    Depending on applicable law, you may have the right to appeal our decision to deny your request, if applicable. If we deny your request, we will provide you with information on how to appeal the decision, if applicable, in our communications with you. To exercise such an appeal right, email us at privacy@ynab.com.

    Marketing Communications. 
    You can unsubscribe from our marketing emails via the unsubscribe link provided in the emails. Please note that it may take us some time, consistent with our legal obligations, to process your request. Even if you opt out from receiving marketing messages from us, you will continue to receive administrative messages from us, such as order confirmations, updates to our policies and practices, or other communications regarding our relationship or transactions with you.

    Mobile Devices. 
    We may send you push notifications through our applications. You may at any time opt out from receiving these types of communications by changing the settings on your mobile device. If you granted us permission to collect your precise GPS location information and you no longer wish for us and our service providers to collect and use such information, you may disable the location features on your device through the device’s operating system settings. Please note that if you disable such features, you may not be able to access or receive some or all of the services, content, and/or features made available via the Services.

    Notice of Right to Opt Out of Sales of Personal Information and Processing/Sharing of Personal Information for Targeted Advertising Purposes. 
    As described in our Cookie Policy, we have incorporated cookies and similar technology from certain third parties into our Services to provide you with more relevant and tailored ads regarding our services and to analyze the performance of our ads and the types of consumers who see and interact with them. We may also share certain identifiers, like a hashed email address, with third-party platforms so that those platforms can display YNAB ads to interested audiences. These technologies allow us and our partners to serve tailored YNAB ads on other platforms, and to limit how often we show ads to consumers who have already subscribed to YNAB.  

    Although these advertising activities are a common way for companies like YNAB to promote their products and services, certain laws categorize these activities as “selling” personal information or “sharing” or “processing” personal information for targeted advertising purposes – even though we never provide information in exchange for money. 

    We want to be clear that we do not under any circumstances “sell” the information you provide through the Product or “share/process” it for targeted advertising purposes, including Financial Data. 

    Nevertheless, our online advertising activities targeting prospective YNAB users may be considered to be a “sale” and/or “sharing/processing” for targeted advertising purposes under the broad definitions of those terms in state privacy laws. These laws require us to make certain disclosures about these activities, which we provide below.

    If you would like to opt out of our online disclosure such as through cookie and pixel technology of your personal information for purposes that could be considered “sales” for those third parties’ own commercial purposes, or “sharing” for purposes of targeted advertising, please follow this link or select “Your Privacy Choices” in the Services, and follow the instructions. You must make this choice on each site/app on each browser/device you use to access the Services. You must also renew this choice if you clear your cookies or your browser is set to do that. 

    You can also submit a request to opt out of the use of your email address and other personal information related to that email address for targeted advertising purposes and to the disclosure of such information to our marketing and business partners by visiting this link. Depending on your jurisdiction, you may be permitted to designate an authorized agent to submit such requests on your behalf. Please note that we do not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age without legally-required affirmative authorization.

    Please note that if you have a legally-recognized browser-based opt-out preference signal turned on via your device browser, we recognize such preference in accordance with applicable law. 

    Notice of Financial Incentives.
    We may offer opportunities to receive certain services or benefits, including money to participate in surveys, sign up for communications, or other similar incentives, which may require the provision of personal information, such as registering for an account and answering surveys or providing additional feedback or information. Such opportunities could be considered a financial incentive under applicable law (each, an “Incentive Program”). Your participation in Incentive Programs is purely voluntary. When you participate in an Incentive Program, you agree to the terms of that Incentive Program, and may revoke your participation depending on the Incentive Program.

    6. Information for California Residents

    This Privacy Policy applies to www.scholarships.com. This Privacy Policy describes how Scholarships.com collects and uses the personal information you provide. It also describes the choices available to you regarding the use of, your access to, and how to update and correct your personal information.

    Scholarships.com recognizes that your privacy is important. To demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy and to explain the types of information we obtain about visitors to our website, how that information is obtained and used, and how visitors can restrict its use or disclosure, we have created the Privacy Policy below. The following discusses our information gathering and dissemination practices at Scholarships.com.

    Information We Receive and How It Is Used
    All personal information obtained by Scholarships.com about individual visitors to our website is information supplied voluntarily by that visitor. During registration, users are required to provide certain categories of information, such as name, address, email address, phone number, a password, date of birth, gender, and country of citizenship. In addition, users may choose to provide other categories of information, such as career objectives, health or disability information, hobbies, and other interests. Scholarships.com encourages users to provide all fields of information to maximize the effectiveness of the scholarship and college search. We ask for permission when sharing information with marketing partners, which are reputable companies and organizations that provide products and services of interest to students and parents. Users may choose whether to opt-in or opt-out of sharing information with our marketing partners.

    When Scholarships.com shares personal information with a third party, the information will become permanently subject to the information use and sharing practices of the third party. The third party will not be restricted by our Privacy Policy, with respect to its use and further sharing of your personal information. If you agree to receive communications from our marketing partners and later change your mind, you will need to contact those companies directly. Any information updates you wish to make must be forwarded to the company at that point in time.

    Upon request Scholarships.com will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. Users may change personal profile information at Scholarships.com at any time by logging in to the website and entering the email address and password associated with their profile. After users have logged in, they will be directed to their Scholarship Matches. In the tabbed navigation at the top of the page, users will find a link to Profile. By clicking on that tab, users will be directed to a summary of their information, divided into sections. An Edit This Section option in the upper-right corner of each section allows users to modify and update their information. Users can also contact us here in order to request access to submitted information. To protect the security and integrity of our users’ information, we will take necessary steps in verifying all new profile identities before providing access. It is the responsibility of the user to make all necessary changes in their profile and make sure their profiles are up-to-date.

    Users of Scholarships.com who wish to terminate their membership, or otherwise request to cease usage of their information at Scholarships.com may do so at any time by contacting us via our contact form by clicking here. Please be sure to type Remove in the subject field and submit the email account associated with the membership you would like terminated. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe. Information will be retained for as long as the account is active or requests our services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

    Scholarships.com is committed to safeguarding users' privacy on our website. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is received. We require our employees to protect our users and visitors by keeping their profile information private, and expect our marketing partners to follow suit. Rest assured that your user profile will be protected when you visit Scholarships.com. There are security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of all user information under our control.

    Regardless of whether you wish to share your personal information, we reserve the right to share aggregated demographic data and related information with our business partners. Such aggregate information will not contain any personal information that can identify any individual user.

    Information Sharing & Email Preferences
    Scholarships.com understands the importance of protecting personally-identifiable information. We will not share, sell, rent or otherwise transfer any information without the user's permission, and then, only in accordance with the terms set forth in this Privacy Policy. Our website provides users the opportunity to unsubscribe/opt-out from receiving email messages from Scholarships.com and its marketing partners, or from having their personal information shared with our marketing partners. Users may change their email preferences by following the unsubscribe instructions contained in each of the email messages they receive or by clicking here. Please allow up to seven business days for these changes to take effect. If you no longer wish to be a registered user of Scholarships.com, you may have your profile removed by clicking here.

    Scholarships.com may periodically use contact information in order to send emails regarding updates at the Scholarships.com site, such as scholarship opportunities and additional listings. The frequency of these messages will vary depending on the user's preference, including the types of scholarships and other activities in which a user has indicated an interest. If you specifically provide Scholarships.com with permission at the time of registration, you may also receive commercial emails. Please note that email messages from third parties are not governed by the opt-out provisions of this Privacy Policy.

    In certain situations, Scholarships.com may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities. We may also disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process. When we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.

    We may provide your personal information to company provider services that help us with business-related activity; such as shipping your order or offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only on a service-needs basis.

    Body

    Updated as of October 23, 2023

    Escalent, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, “Escalent”, formerly known as Market Strategies International-Morpace) is committed to protecting the privacy of our clients and research participants.

    We make our website, including this privacy policy, accessible to individuals with disabilities. If you are having trouble accessing the website or this privacy policy, please contact us as provided in the “Contact Us” section below.

    This privacy policy applies to all client and personal information that we collect or use in the course of conducting our business, as well as all client information and research participant data housed at any Escalent facility or stored on the Escalent network. Anyone who has access to such information or data must follow this privacy policy.

    This privacy policy constitutes a binding agreement between you and Escalent. Your use of our website or our services, or your participation in research, constitutes your consent to the terms and conditions in this privacy policy.

    Your Personal Information
    As used in this privacy policy, the term “personal information” or “personal data” means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular individual or household. Even in the absence of a full name, certain pieces of information, such as demographic information, a mailing address or other location information, or even device ID’s or IP addresses, may be deemed personal information.

    We may collect personal information for the purpose of conducting market research, as expressly stated and agreed to by you, and as otherwise provided in this privacy policy.

    Depending on your location, you may have certain rights under the law of your home jurisdiction with respect to your personal information. To access, correct, or request deletion of your personal information, or to request a copy of your personal information or opt out of the processing of your personal information, please contact us as provided in the “Contact Us” section below. Depending on your location, you may also have the right to appeal any decision we make regarding your personal data by contacting us as provided below.

    Individuals in California and Europe have certain special rights as further described in the applicable sections below.

    Sensitive Personal Information
    Please note that some of the personal information we collect and process may constitute “sensitive” personal information under applicable laws. We will never use your sensitive personal information except for research purposes, or otherwise to verify your identity or prevent fraud. For more information on how to opt out of the processing of your sensitive personal information, please click here.

    Client Information
    We treat all information we receive from clients as confidential and do not use the information for any purpose other than to fulfill our obligations to them. We keep client information secure at all times, and prevent the misuse and unauthorized disclosure of it by our employees or any third parties.

    Research Participant Information
    Information collected from research participants may include names, email addresses, IP addresses, and unique identifiers; log files, browser type, operating system, and other device information; respondent photos, video, and audio; biometric information and geolocation data; and commercial information, including records of personal property, products or services purchased, obtained, or considered, or other purchasing or consuming histories or tendencies.

    In order to provide our services to clients, we may also employ the use of client contact lists which would contain personal information such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, and mailing addresses. On studies involving European citizens or other individuals covered by the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), client contact lists or other personal data will only be processed in accordance with the parameters described with more particularity in the “EU Respondents” section below.

    On studies involving PRC citizens or other individuals covered by the Personal Information Protection Law (“PIPL”), client contact lists or other personal data will only be processed in accordance with the parameters described with more particularity in the “Notice to PRC Residents” section.

    All responses to our research are completely confidential. We collect data in our studies for research purposes only, and our use of that information will be limited to that purpose. Research participant answers will not be used by any entity as an aid for sales.

    Research participation is voluntary, and sample members always have the opportunity to decline involvement or to “opt out” of the research after agreeing to participate.

    Sharing and Use of Personal Information
    In order to provide services, we may share personal information about you with our clients or other collaboration partners, such as your contact information or certain combinations of anonymized or pseudonymized demographic and other information.

    We may also disclose certain information for confidential use by our service providers, including without limitation log files, browser type, operating system, and other machine information.

    We do not rent, sell or give personal information to any third party for the purpose of directly marketing any products or services. In some cases, we may need to share personal information with third parties that provide research services in support of the research project. Any third party that receives personal information is obligated to follow all of the same privacy protection regulations as followed by Escalent.

    At their request, we give research participants access to the personal information we have collected about them, we correct any information that is inaccurate or incomplete, change their consent status, or have their personal information deleted. All requests of this nature can be sent to privacy@escalent.co.

    Otherwise we may use your personal information to maintain, monitor and improve our services; to maintain the safety and security of our services; and to prevent illegal or abusive conduct.

    In addition to the sharing discussed above, we may also share your information in the following ways: (a) as reasonably necessary to comply with law or a legal process (including a court or government order or subpoena), to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, to enforce this privacy policy, and to protect the rights, property or safety of Escalent, our users, and/or the public; (b) if we sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of our business or assets, including your personal information, in connection with a corporate transaction such as a merger, consolidation, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy, in which case we will make reasonable efforts to require the recipient to honor this privacy policy; or (c) with your express consent.

    Notice to California Residents
    If you are a California resident, you also have the following special rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”):

    Your Right to “Know”, to Request Deletion, and to Correct

    You have the right to know the categories and specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.

    You have the right to know the categories of sources from which the personal information has been collected, the business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling, or sharing personal information, and the categories of third parties with whom we share personal information.

    You have the right to request deletion of personal information we’ve collected or maintain, subject to certain exceptions.

    You also have the right to correct any inaccurate personal information that we maintain about you.

    To exercise these rights contact us at (877) 631-3505 or by filling out this webform link. We may ask you to provide additional information in order to verify who is making the request.

    Please note that any requested disclosures may only apply to the 12-month period preceding the request, depending on how difficult it is for us to retrieve the necessary information, and you are entitled to request disclosure regarding your personal information twice in any 12-month period.

    Your Right to Opt Out and Limit Processing of Sensitive Personal Information

    CCPA defines the term “sell” broadly. Its meaning includes “renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, [and] transferring…for monetary or other valuable consideration.” Under this definition, and the CCPA’s broad definition of “personal information,” some information we share with clients may constitute a “sale” under CCPA.

    You have the right to opt out of this “sale” of your personal information. For more information on how to exercise this right, please click here.

    You also have the right to limit our processing of sensitive personal information. For more information on how to exercise this right, please click here.

    Personal Information “Sold” and “Disclosed”

    You also have the right to know what categories of personal information we’ve “sold” or disclosed for a business purpose, and the third parties to whom that information was “sold” or disclosed.

    In the last 12 months we’ve “sold” the following categories of information to our clients in connection with delivery of our services: (1) demographic data, such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, parental status, marital status, ZIP code, income and education levels; (2) log files, browser type, operating system, and other device information; (3) respondent photos, video, and audio; (4) biometric information and geolocation data; and (5) commercial information, including records of personal property, products or services purchased, obtained, or considered, or other purchasing or consuming histories or tendencies.

    In the last 12 months we’ve disclosed the following categories of information to the following parties for a business purpose: (1) Respondent names, email addresses, IP addresses, and unique identifiers with our vendors (e.g., as required for secure database management, recruiting, and honoraria distribution); (2) Demographic data, such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, parental status, marital status, ZIP code, income and education levels, biometric information, geolocation data, and commercial information, including records of personal property, products or services purchased, obtained, or considered, or other purchasing or consuming histories or tendencies, with our data collection partners; (3) Log files, browser type, operating system, and other device information with our third-party service providers; (4) Respondent photos, video, and audio with vendors (e.g., focus group facilities) and contractors (e.g., focus group moderators and videographers); and (5) business partner employee names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses with our third-party service providers.

    Your Right to Non-Discrimination

    You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by Escalent for the exercise of the privacy rights conferred by the CCPA, including but not limited to by denying you services, charging different prices or rates, or providing you with a different level or quality of services. Please understand, however, that we are in the business of providing research and survey results to our clients, and any financial incentives we offer to facilitate that goal may be rewarded only if the applicable survey, research project or study is fully and properly completed by the respondent, in the sole discretion of Escalent.

    Your Right to Use an Authorized Agent

    You have the right to designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf. To designate an authorized agent, please contact us as provided below. In order to verify you have authorized an agent we will require a signed, written authorization from you.

    Verification Process

    If you make a request to access or delete your information, or to opt out of the sale of your personal information, we may ask you for additional information to verify your identity. This information may include: your full name, birth date, phone number, email address, or other basic personal information about you that we already have on file.

    Notice of Financial Incentive

    Escalent may offer opportunities for you to earn money and rewards by answering surveys or any other forms of research. Participation in these offerings may require you to provide personal information. For more information about how to opt in to these offerings, or about how to opt out once you have opted in, see the notices and official rules accompanying these incentives.

    Cookies

Cookies which may be utilized by Escalent are within the following four primary categories or uses:

    Opt-Out Policy
    If you wish to be removed from Escalent email or phone contact lists, please complete our Do Not Contact form.

    Information Security
    We maintain all necessary physical, electronic and procedural security measures to help safeguard client data and personal information. All of our employees undergo security awareness at the time of hire and then annually thereafter. Third parties that provide us with support or services may also receive client data or personal information, and we require them to maintain security measures similar to ours with respect to such information. Nevertheless, the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide to us. If any information under our control is compromised, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and, where appropriate, notify those individuals whose information may have been compromised, and also take other steps as necessary in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations.

    Data Integrity
    Escalent will take reasonable steps to ensure the personal data is accurate, complete, current and relevant, and is used only as described in the “Data Retention” section below. While we accept responsibility for the management and confidentiality of the personal information collected, please note that we do not always have control over the accuracy of the information provided directly to us, and accept no responsibility for information’s accuracy in such cases.

    Data Retention
    In general, to determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. We may also process data on behalf of third parties who have engaged us. We keep personal information processed on behalf of third parties for as long as needed to provide services to the third party in question. Notwithstanding anything above to the contrary, we reserve the right to retain personal information for any period required by law or to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

    Third Parties
    Our website may contain links to external websites, and areas where you can provide information to third parties. These are provided for your convenience only, and we do not have control over the content or privacy and security practices and policies of such third parties or third-party sites. Any personal information you provide in such areas, and on such linked pages, is provided directly to that third party and is subject to that third party’s privacy policy. Please learn about the privacy and security practices and policies of external websites and third-parties before providing them with personal information.

    Notice to EU Respondents
    Any data to be transferred for any reason is limited and for specified research purposes only. Any vendors or third parties working with or for Escalent are contractually obligated to comply with Escalent guidelines for confidentiality and data security, and in compliance with Insights Association requirements.

    Escalent strictly abides by Insights Association Code of Conduct. You can opt out of any and all participation at any time with no penalty or hesitation. Your participation is entirely voluntary. If you wish to be removed from Escalent email or phone contact lists, please complete our Do Not Contact form. If there’s an opportunity to participate in a research activity that does not include surveys, and if this opportunity includes any sort of media or self-identification, you will always be asked for permission to participate in said activities prior to collection of data. You can continue participation in other research activities and choose not to participate in anything that identifies you in special research requests, with no penalty or hesitation. All participation is by permission only. You may discontinue your participation in research with Escalent at any time. Any communication requesting participation by others in the household will be clearly communicated to the primary research participation, with no requirement for participation.

    We will not process your personal data unless: (a) you have given your consent to our processing for a specific purpose; (b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you or to comply with a legal obligation; or (c) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Escalent or a third-party controller. In cases where the purpose of our processing is the “legitimate interest” purpose, we will also carefully balance those interests against your fundamental rights and freedoms related to your Information. Where processing is based on your consent, we will identify the processing purposes and provide you with relevant information to make the processing fair and transparent.

    Escalent remains responsible for any of your personal information that is shared under the Onward Transfer principle with third parties for external processing on our behalf, as described in the ‘Sharing your information’ section.

    Escalent respects your concerns about privacy. Escalent complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce.

    Do Not Track Signals
    We do not monitor or follow “Do Not Track” (DNT) signals because there is no standard interpretation or practice for DNT signals. Therefore, we handle all user information consistent with this privacy policy. We will never use browsing activity information from our survey respondents or other website visitors to provide or offer third party advertising content. We will treat any “do not sell” or similar signals as opt-out requests under CCPA.

    Compliance, Data Protection Officer
    As members of the Insights Association and European Society of Opinion and Marketing Research (ESOMAR), we strive to model our policies according to those guidelines. As a company based in the United States, and being Privacy Shield certified, Escalent is also subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). If you are concerned about our use of personal or client information, please contact us by email at privacy@escalent.co.

    We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time. If we decide to change our policy, we will prominently post those changes here and any other place we deem appropriate, so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If we make any material changes, we will notify you either by way of an email or by a notice on our website. We will use information in accordance with the policy as it was in effect at the time information was collected.

    Class Action Waiver
    Any arbitration or court trial, whether before a judge or jury or pursuant to judicial reference, related to any claim under this privacy policy will take place on an individual basis, without resort to any form of class or representative action (“Class Action Waiver”). THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER PRECLUDES ANY PARTY FROM PARTICIPATING IN OR BEING REPRESENTED IN ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION REGARDING A CLAIM UNDER THIS PRIVACY POLICY. Regardless of anything else herein, the validity and effect of the Class Action Waiver may be determined only by a court and not by an arbitrator.

The types of personal information you may provide to us includes:

    Personal or business contact information (such as name, address and email address, pet name, pet breed and type, social media, name of your company or department, and your business function or title);
    Demographic information (such as age, gender, physical characteristics and their pet’s health concerns);
    A general geographic location (such as country and city) from which a visitor accesses our sites;
    Information you provide by interacting with us through our sites, including by submitting questions, commenting on our forums and interacting with us through social media;
    Information provided through social media networks or one of our mobile applications when you visit our social media pages or use one of our mobile applications (such as your name, profile picture, likes, location, friend list and other information described on the social media network or application sign-up page, or your geo-location details when using one of our mobile applications);
    Contact information of individuals with whom you would like to share our content; Payment information (such as account or credit card number for processing through our third party payment processor); and
    Other details that you may submit to us or that may be included in the information provided to us by third parties.
    If you submit any personal information relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with the services (such as if you gift a subscription to another person), you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Policy.

    When you visit our site, view or click on our online advertisements (including our advertisements on third party websites), visit our social media pages or download and use one of our mobile applications, we also collect certain information about your usage or device by automated means or by using technologies such as cookies, web server logs and web beacons. As set forth in more detail below, we may also collect information about your usage and browsing habits using various web-based technologies. The information we may collect automatically includes:

    Usage information. Whenever you visit or interact with our sites, we, as well as any third-party advertisers and/or service providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how our sites are accessed and used (“Usage information”). Usage information may include browser type, device type, operating system, application version, the page served, the time, the preceding page views, and your use of features or applications on our sites, as well as search terms that visitors use to reach our sites. This information helps us keep our sites usable for our visitors and allows us to tailor content to a visitor’s interests.
    Device Identifier. We automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) for the Device (computer, mobile phone, tablet or other device) you use to access our sites. A Device Identifier is a number that is assigned to your Device when you access a website or its servers, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. We may use a Device Identifier to, among other things, administer our sites, help diagnose problems with our servers, analyze trends, track users’ web page movements, help identify you and your interests, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
    Cookies; Pixel Tags. The technologies used on our sites to collect Usage information, including Device Identifiers, include but are not limited to: cookies (data files placed on a Device when it is used to visit our sites), mobile analytics software and pixel tags (transparent graphic image, sometimes called a web beacon or tracking beacon, placed on a web page or in an email, which indicates that a page or email has been viewed). Cookies may also be used to associate you with social networking sites like Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Google+, Twitter and, if you so choose, enable interaction between your activities on our sites and your activities on such social networking sites. We, or our partners, may place cookies or similar files on your Device for security purposes, to facilitate site navigation, to perform analytics, and personalize your experience while visiting our sites (such as allowing us to select which ads or offers are most likely to appeal to you, based on your interests, preferences, location or demographic information). A pixel tag may tell your browser to get content from another server.
    To learn how you may be able to reduce the number of cookies you receive from us, or delete cookies that have already been installed in your browser’s cookie folder, or prevent tracking activities, please refer to your browser’s tools or help menu or other instructions related to your browser. Because an industry-standard Do-Not-Track protocol has not yet been established, our information collection practices on our sites will continue to operate as described in this online privacy policy regardless of any “Do Not Track” signals that may be sent by certain browsers. However, you may refuse to accept cookies in order to prevent tracking activities. If you disable or opt out of receiving cookies, please be aware that some features and services on our sites may not work properly because we may not be able to recognize and associate you with your account. In addition, the offers we provide when you visit us may not be as relevant to you or tailored to your interests. We may use third-party website analytics tools that collect automated information about visitor traffic on our sites, such as Google Analytics. You can learn how Google collects and processes data by going to www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.
    How We Use the Information We Collect

    We use the information we collect for a variety of business purposes such as to respond to your questions and requests for services; provide you with access to certain areas and features; purchase history; verify your identity; communicate with you about your account and activities on our sites, modify or change any of our policies; tailor content, advertisements, and offers we serve you; improve our sites; comply with contractual obligations; and for purposes disclosed at the time you provide your personal information or otherwise with your consent. We may also collect information for purposes such as:

    Communicate with you (including by phone or by email) about our products, services, offers, surveys, events and promotions, and oﬀer products and services we believe may be of interest to you;
    Create and manage your online account, including access to your online purchase history, assist with online selection and replenishment, process your payment card and/or gift card transactions;
    Publish your testimonials about Alpha Paw, including on our sites, forums, blogs, and social media assets (if we choose to publish your testimonial, we will generally only include your name, title and company name);

    Analyze and enhance our marketing communications and lead generation strategies (including by identifying when emails sent to you have been received and read);
    Analyze trends and statistics regarding visitors’ use of our sites; and Protect against fraud and unauthorized transactions.
    We may combine the information we collect with publicly available information and information we receive from our affiliated companies, business partners and other third parties. We may use that combined information for the purposes described in this Policy. On our sites, we may collect information about your online activities to provide advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests. You may see certain ads on our sites and other sites because we participate in advertising networks. Ad networks allow us to target our advertising to users through demographic, behavioral and contextual means. These networks may track your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services, including by collecting information through automated means through the use of cookies, web server logs, web beacons and other methods. These networks may place cookies, web beacons or similar tracking devices while you are visiting our sites or other sites. The networks use this information to show you advertisements for Alpha Paw and our business partners that are tailored to your individual interests. They may also use the information they collect for their own purposes. The information our ad network vendors collect includes information about your visits to websites that participate in the vendors’ advertising networks, such as the pages or advertisements you have viewed, and the actions you take on the sites. This data collection and ad targeting take place both on our sites and on third-party websites that participate in the ad networks. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.

We may share non-personal information, such as aggregate data and Usage information with third parties.

We may also share the information with our service providers that perform services on our behalf. We do not authorize these service providers to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform certain services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. We also may share information about you with other third parties when we have given you an opportunity to opt out of such sharing and you do not opt out.

    While on our sites, you may have the opportunity to opt-in to receive information and/or marketing offers from someone else or to otherwise consent to the sharing of your information with a third party, including social networking sites. If you agree to have your personal information shared, your personal information will be disclosed to the third party and the personal information you disclose will be subject to the privacy policy and business practices of that third party. We may share your personal information with other entities and our affiliates primarily for business and operational purposes. In the event that we are involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. We may transfer and disclose your information to third parties to comply with a legal obligation; when we believe in good faith that the law or a governmental authority requires it; to verify or enforce our terms and conditions or other applicable policies; to address fraud, security or technical issues; to respond to an emergency; or otherwise to protect our rights or property or security of third parties, visitors to our sites or the public.

    Other Websites, Data Processing and Safeguards

    Our sites may contain links to other sites that we do not own or operate. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and/or partners that may use our logo(s) as part of a co-branding or co-marketing agreement. We do not control, recommend or endorse and are not responsible for these sites or their content, products, services or privacy policies or practices. These other sites may send their own cookies to your Device, they may independently collect data or solicit personal information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. You should also independently assess the authenticity of any site which appears or claims that it is one of our sites (including those linked to through an email or social networking page). This is a U.S. website subject to U.S. law, including applicable privacy and information security requirements. When you visit this site, we may process information about you outside of the country in which you are located, including in the U.S. By using our services, you consent to the transfer of information to countries outside of your country of residence, including the United States, which may have data protection rules that are different from those of your country.

    IP Address
    Operating System type

    Mediavine Partners (companies listed below with whom Mediavine shares data) may also use this data to link to other end user information the partner has independently collected to deliver targeted advertisements. Mediavine Partners may also separately collect data about end users from other sources, such as advertising IDs or pixels, and link that data to data collected from Mediavine publishers in order to provide interest-based advertising across your online experience, including devices, browsers and apps. This data includes usage data, cookie information, device information, information about interactions between users and advertisements and websites, geolocation data, traffic data, and information about a visitor’s referral source to a particular website. Mediavine Partners may also create unique IDs to create audience segments, which are used to provide targeted advertising.
