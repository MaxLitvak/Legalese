    "text": "Global Privacy Notice for Passengers and Riders This privacy notice lets you know how we promise to look after your personal data. This notice tells you things like what information we use to provide you with our bundle of transportation services, how we use your information to keep you safe, and the choices and controls available to you. This notice also tells you about your privacy rights and how data protection rules work to protect everyone. Bolt Operations OÜ is the Controller of your personal data unless otherwise stated below. Our postal address is: Vana-Lõuna 15 Tallinn 10134 Estonia We have nominated a Data Protection Officer, and you can contact him at privacy@bolt.eu or via any one of our postal addresses found in the city pages. Please mark the envelope ‘Data Protection Officer’. The term “us” or “we” refers to Bolt Operations OÜ, a private limited company incorporated and registered under the laws of the Republic of Estonia with registration code 14532901. The term “you” or “your” refers to the passenger or rider who requests, hires and/or receives a transportation service through their Bolt app account. 1. Personal data we process We only process information that we need, so that we can provide you with the best service on our transportation marketplace. The data categories are as follows: Contact details: things like name, phone number and e-mail address. For some of our services we might require a little more, like your home address. Profile information: things like your profile picture, saved addresses, language and communication preferences. For some of our services we might require a little more, like your driver license details. Geolocation: such as where you need a ride from, or the location of nearby scooters to you, the time, the journey progression and the final destination of your trip. Payment information like the amount charged and the payment card used. Communication and correspondence records such as when you engage with our in-app chat, or speak with our customer service agents. Limited identification data of the device, like the IP address, on which the Bolt app has been installed Data about the usage of the transportation services: things like data about journey status, times and data about your conduct as assessed by drivers. Data on sensors for rental vehicles. It contains information such as vehicle speed, engine power, driving style information (including sudden braking or skidding) and the total weight of objects and person(s) on the vehicle and changes in the weight. Other user-generated content such as photos of parked e-vehicles, feedback submitted, and audio recordings taken during the trip (as part of our safety toolkit trip audio recording feature, where such feature is available - for more information, please visit: https://bolt.eu/en-ee/rider/safety/). In addition to above mentioned sources, we may collect and receive your data from other sources, which include: Drivers and third parties who provide information and content in connection to the service or in regard to possible claims and disputes; and Users who participate in our referral campaigns. In that case we receive the referred person’s information from that user. A lack of (or inaccurate) personal data may prevent us from fulfilling our contract with you, or from doing something expected of us in law. It may also mean that we cannot operate your account. For example, we collect and process the personal data submitted by you in the course of installing and using the Bolt app; refusing to share geolocation data via the App means we cannot direct a driver to your location for pick-up, nor can we show you one of our own vehicles close to you for hire. We will not be able to fulfil our obligations to you in other circumstances, for example, should you refuse to undertake an identity verification check to ensure the integrity of your account, then the account may be suspended or blocked to prevent fraud. 2. Purpose of the processing We process your personal data so we can provide you with one or more of our transportation services: We connect you with a driver, help find you a scooter or hire a vehicle: We collect and process personal data for the purpose of connecting passengers with drivers so you can be picked up and dropped off; or to show you where our nearest available hire-vehicles are located, such as our cars or scooters. Instant messages directly in the Bolt app are processed in order to provide service and customer support (including resolving disputes between driver and rider), for security purposes as well as to improve our products and services, and for analysis. We get you to where you want to go: We display geolocation data and the phone number of passengers to drivers when ride-hailing to enable efficient pick-up and drop-off, and make the journey and route transparent. This data is collected only when the Bolt app is activated. The collection of geolocation data stops after closing the Bolt app. In some countries drivers cannot see passengers' phone numbers; the driver sees an altogether different number which temporarily diverts to the passenger's phone number meaning the driver and passenger can still communicate. We make sure your journey goes smoothly: We use geolocation data to make sure you get to your destination and resolve quality issues related to our services. We also need to know where you choose to drop off a hire-vehicle so we can bill correctly, recharge batteries and maintain our fleet. We make sure the app is optimal: We use contact details to notify passengers and riders of updates to the Bolt app so you can keep using our services. We also gather limited data from the device that you use to connect you with our internet, mobile and telephone services, and to help keep your account safe through authentication and verification checks. We make sure your ride is the quickest, cheapest and most convenient to you: We collect data on the routes taken by our passengers and riders to analyse geographic coverage. This lets us do things like improve recommendations to the drivers about the most efficient routes, and helps us make sure that our hire-vehicles, like our scooters, are in the most convenient locations for customers. We collect your payment: We obtain payment details to process passenger payment on behalf of drivers for ride-hailing. And we process payments for our own hire-vehicles, such as for our cars and scooters, too. We maintain and promote standards: We collect data about journey statuses, time and passenger ratings from driver feedback to encourage user safety, promote compliance with our terms and conditions, and make sure we’re providing a quality and enjoyable service to everyone. Customer support data and correspondence is collected for the purposes of feedback, and resolving disputes and service quality issues. We keep you informed: Your name, phone number and email address will be used to communicate with you for things like letting you know that your journey has been completed, sending you trip confirmation slips and receipts, and letting you know about important service updates such as when bad weather suspends the hiring of ours scooters. When using Bolt rental vehicles, we process the data collected through the sensors of the rental vehicles for security purposes, to identify potentially dangerous driving behaviour and, if necessary, to send notifications to the data subject about the identified dangerous behaviour – i.e., when there is a significant weight change compared to previous ride. The corresponding notification has no serious consequences for the data subject – the goal is to ensure a safe driving style. We may process all personal data about you for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims in case we need to defend against or give proof of claims for damages, or other claims submitted to us for investigation. Please see additional purposes for which we process your personal data under legitimate interest (Clause 3 below). 3. Legal Basis We are allowed to use personal information in the ways described above if we have a proper reason to do so. We always make sure we have a good reason for doing anything with your data. Entry into and performance of the contract (incl., provision of service): Personal data is generally processed in order to provide the services contracted through the Bolt app with you. This means that to give you the service we promised you, and to meet our terms and conditions, we’ll process your personal data to meet those obligations. Legitimate interest: We generally in other circumstances process your personal data relying on legitimate interest grounds, if we have concluded a legitimate interest assessment. Legitimate interests include our commercial interests in providing an innovative, personalised, safe and profitable service to our passengers and partners, unless those interests are overridden by other interests. We may process your personal data (excluding special categories of personal data) based on legitimate interest for the following purposes: for the purpose of investigating and detecting fraudulent payments, malicious activities or unlawful activities, and/or safety or security incidents (depending on the nature of the investigation, all data categories may be processed); maintaining the safety and security of our network and systems, and responding to suspected or actual criminal acts; making and reviewing recordings and logs: we may record messages and orders given both in our premises and using means of communication (e-mail, phone calls, the Bolt app, etc.) as well as information and other activities we have performed. We may also review audio recordings submitted to us using our safety toolkit trip audio recording feature (where such feature is available). If necessary, we use these recordings for investigations, proof and protection against claims and/or for quality assurance; and implementing and maintaining features to ensure the security of our services; and establishing, exercising or defending legal claims, including: (i) supporting our own internal investigations; (ii) the assignment of claims and the use of debt collecting agencies; and (iii) the use of legal advisors (depending on the claim all data may be processed). Depending on the particular circumstances, we may, from time to time rely on alternative legal basis when it is more appropriate to do so, these may include: when it is necessary to comply with a legal obligation such as for processing data when the law requires it, including, for example, if there is a valid legal request to disclose personal information to a third party such as a Court or regulatory authority; when it is necessary to protect your vital interests, or those of others, for example in the event of an emergency or an imminent threat to life; and/or when you have given us clear consent to do so for another specific purpose for which you have been fully informed. In countries where legitimate interest is not an available lawful basis for Bolt’s processing activities, Bolt instead relies on an alternative valid legal basis available as set out above. Where personal data is processed for a new purpose other than that for which the personal data are originally collected and the processing is not based on the data subject’s consent, we carefully assess the permissibility of such new processing. We will, in order to ascertain whether processing for a new purpose is compatible with the purpose for which the personal data are initially collected, take into account, inter alia: any link between the purposes for which the personal data are collected and the purposes of the intended further processing; the context in which the personal data are collected, in particular regarding the relationship between you and us; the nature of the personal data, in particular whether special categories of personal data are processed or whether personal data related to criminal convictions and offences are processed; the possible consequences of the intended further processing for you; and the existence of appropriate safeguards, which may include encryption or pseudonymisation. 4. Recipients We only work with trusted partners and authorities. We only share when there is a proper reason to do so. We limit sharing to only that which is required. We do not sell your personal information. The personal data of the passenger is only disclosed to the ride-hailing drivers when they engage with a ride on in the Bolt app; in such a case, the driver will see the name, phone number (in some countries the number is masked), rating and geolocation data of the passenger. After providing the transportation service, the name and the telephone number (in some countries the number is masked) of the ride-hailing passenger will remain visible to the driver for 24-48 hours. This is necessary for drivers to resolve any issues with the passenger like getting something special back to you which might have been left in the car. Oops! Feedback given by passengers regarding the quality of the ride-hailing service is anonymous. Your rating is private between you and Bolt. Depending on the location of the passenger, the personal data may be disclosed to the Bolt group companies and partners (local subsidiaries, representatives, affiliates, agents etc). Processing of personal data by Bolt group companies and partners will occur under the same strict conditions as established in this privacy notice. You can read more on your country page. In some circumstances we are legally obliged to share information with external recipients. For example, under a Court Order or where we cooperate with a data protection supervisory authority in handling complaints or investigations. We can also respond to requests, such as those from law enforcement agencies, when we have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction or furthers a public interest task, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognised standards. In any scenario, we’ll always satisfy ourselves that we have a lawful basis on which to share the information, and we’ll make sure that we document our decision. 5. Security and access Any personal data collected in the course of providing our services is transferred to and stored in the data centres of Zone Media Ltd. and/or Amazon Web Services, Inc., which are located in the territories of Member States of the European Union. Only authorised employees of Bolt group companies and partners have access to the personal data and they may access the data only for the purpose of resolving issues associated with the use of the services (including disputes regarding transportation services). Bolt group companies and partners can access personal data to the extent necessary to provide customer support in the respective country. For our research and scientific purposes, all data, like bulk geolocation data, is anonymised so you can never be identified from it. 6. Your rights and controls We want you to stay in control of your personal data. Bolt provides you with controls through the app where you can view your personal information including your profile data and trip history. We also offer in-app settings like marketing opt-ins, and transparent cookie consent controls on our website. Your right of access You can access your personal data via the Bolt app. You have the right to ask us for copies of your personal information. There are some exemptions, such as when we have to balance the rights of others, which means you may not always receive all the information we process. Your right to rectification You can access and update your personal data via the Bolt app. You have the right to ask us to rectify information you think is otherwise inaccurate. You also have the right to ask us to complete information you think is incomplete. Your right to erasure You have the right to ask us to erase your personal information in certain circumstances. Your right to restriction of processing You have the right to ask us to restrict the processing of your information in certain circumstances. This means that your data can only be used for certain things, such as legal claims or to exercise legal rights. Your right to object to processing You may have the right to object to processing if we are processing your information on the basis of legitimate interests. You may object at any time to the processing of your personal data which involves automated processing or profiling which has a significant effect on your rights and to require human intervention. You also have the right to require an explanation regarding the logic behind an automated decision we have made. Your right to data portability You have the right to ask that we transfer the information you gave us from one organisation to another, or give it to you, in certain circumstances. This only applies to information you have given us. The retention period for the data about instant messages directly in the Bolt app messages is 90 days, except cases where messages are related to a reported incident - in which case we will store them for 6 months.. 7. Retention Bolt retains user data for only as long as necessary for the purposes described above. This means that we retain different categories of data for different periods of time depending on the type of data, the transportation service it relates to, and the purposes for which we collected the data. Your personal data will be stored as long as you have an active passenger account. If your account is closed, personal data will be deleted (according to our retention schedule and rules), unless such data is still required to meet any legal obligation, or for accounting, dispute resolution or fraud prevention purposes. Financial data regarding transportation services provided to passengers will be stored for three years after the last journey. Data required for other accounting purposes will be stored for seven years after the last journey. In the event that there are formal investigations of a criminal offence, fraud or false information having been provided, the data will be stored as long as necessary according to the internal, legal, and regulatory requirements. In case of payment disputes, data will be retained until the claim is satisfied or the expiry date of such claims. Journey history data and the data about usage of transportation services will be stored for three years, after which the data will be anonymized. Data on sensors for rental vehicles is stored 6 months. Please note that the deinstallation of Bolt app in your device does not cause the deletion of your personal data. If the Bolt app has not been used for three years, we’ll get in touch and ask you to confirm whether you wish to keep your account active for future use. If no reply is received in a reasonable time, the account will be closed and personal data will be deleted unless such data is required for any purpose mentioned earlier in this privacy notice. The retention period for audio recording data generated through our Audio Trip Recording Feature is: 24 hours, while stored locally on the device of the person who generates the recording. The recordings are automatically deleted after 24 hours if a report to Bolt’s customer support team is not created and the recording is not explicitly shared with Bolt’s customer support team as part of the report. Recordings shared and investigated by Bolt will be automatically deleted after 7 days unless the retention period is manually extended for investigation/legal reasons. 8. Direct marketing We may send direct marketing messages to your e-mail address and/or phone number when you have given us permission to do so, or under a soft opt-in basis. We may personalise direct marketing messages using information on how you use Bolt’s services, such as how frequently you use the Bolt app, and your transportation preferences. If you no longer wish to receive direct marketing messages, please click the Unsubscribe link in the footer of one of our emails, or opt-out in the profile section of the Bolt app. Easy. 9. Automated decision making We use help of automated decision-making in case of issuing warnings and implementing ride hailing service suspension. Using automated decision-making is less error-prone, more efficient and safer than using our employees. Data about your usage of the transportation services (data about journey status incl. cancellations and no-shows and data about your conduct as assessed by drivers) is considered when assessing the need for a warning or suspension. You can read more about the use of automated decision-making here. Ride hailing suspension will stay in force for 6 months, after which access to ride hailing service will be restored. We may also use automated decision-making in order to undertake fraud checks which are necessary for us to perform our services, ensure that the services are paid for and ensure the protection of riders from fraudulent transactions on their payment cards. We may use automated decision-making in order to verify you which is necessary to ensure the safety of our platform and the enforcement of our terms and conditions. We may also use automated decision-making for complaint resolution purposes. We may use the complaints information you provide to our customer support team via our chat function. The information relating to your complaints may be used to generate an automated response which will then be evaluated by a human agent to make the final decision. In cases where we use automated processing or profiling that has a significant effect on your rights, you may have the right for human intervention and the right on grounds relating to your particular situation to object to the processing of personal data concerning you based on automated decisions/profiling as set out in section “Your rights and controls”, and to express your point of view and contest the outcome of the decision by contacting our customer support in our app.You may also be entitled to an explanation regarding the logic of making an automated decision. Please note that certain exceptions and limitations may apply to your right to object to automated decision-making, as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. We will provide you with clear information regarding the implications of exercising your rights and the processes involved in objecting to automated decision-making. 10. Dispute resolution Disputes relating to the processing of personal data are resolved through customer support (info@bolt.eu) in the first instance. You have the right to contact Bolt's Data Protection Officer (privacy@bolt.eu). Our supervisory authority is the Estonian Data Protection Inspectorate (www.aki.ee ↗). You have the right to lodge a complaint to the supervisory authority if you believe that we have processed your personal data unlawfully or have not complied with our legal obligations. 11. Making this notice great We hope you have found this privacy notice easy to understand. Data protection laws are important. They strengthen rules and enhance your information rights. Many of these rules may appear complicated, but most are grounded in common sense. We take our responsibilities with your data seriously. Bolt will continue to make changes to this privacy notice as part of our commitment to protecting your privacy and affording you even more transparency. Further information is available in the local Terms and Conditions for Passengers which can be located here."

    "text": "Privacy Policy for Citizen Services Citizen’s mission is to keep you safe and informed. Protecting your privacy is fundamental to the way sp0n, Inc., the company that does business as Citizen and operates the Citizen mobile app and www.citizen.com, including its subsidiaries and affiliated entities under common ownership and control, (“sp0n” or “Citizen”, “Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) conduct business and provide our services. This Privacy Policy describes our collection, use and disclosure of the information we may collect from you whenever you visit any of our digital properties, website(s) (hereinafter a “Site” and collectively the “Sites”), or otherwise interact with us or access any of our application, products, services, and content (hereinafter the “Platform”). The Sites and the Platform are together referred to in this Privacy Policy as the “Services”. This Privacy Policy applies to all visitors and customers accessing the Services. If you become an inactive customer, or if we close or suspend your account, we will continue to adhere to the Privacy Policy in place when we collect your personal information as long as we retain it in our databases. We may delete any or all of your information at any time without notice to you or for any reason or no reason unless we are otherwise required by law or retain it. You may have other privacy protections under state laws and we encourage you to refer to the Jurisdiction Specific Privacy Rights Statement to review these. Unless otherwise specifically noted, this Policy does not apply to your use of third-party sites linked to in the Services. Updates and Supplemental Notices to this Privacy Policy We may provide additional or supplemental privacy notices for specific products or services that we offer at the time of collection. Unless otherwise noted, those supplemental notices should be read together with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy may change from time to time. The “Effective Date” legend at the top of this page indicates when this Privacy Policy was last revised. Any changes will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy and your continued access to the Services is deemed to be your acceptance of those changes, so we encourage you to check back periodically for updates. Citizen Privacy Practices Our principles for protecting your data We record the information we need to provide our services: informing you of incidents happening around you, and helping you get emergency assistance when you’re in need. The personal information we do collect we store for as short a duration as possible. And, where possible, we store only de-identified or aggregate data that is not tied to you. We generally limit access to your data to a subset of the engineering team. We have specific systems to control data access, and all access is logged and regularly audited. We take protecting your location data seriously. We need accurate, real-time location data to alert you of any emergencies and to help you get emergency assistance, but we lower the resolution of historical location data where possible. We test the stability and security of our infrastructure, including annual penetration testing and review of our security systems and their configurations. We use an information security firm to provide these services under a strict non-disclosure agreement. Our services are designed to provide real-time notifications of incidents occurring near you, and to help you get assistance in the case of an emergency. We can only provide those services in certain areas, so if you are located outside of one of those areas, the services may not work for you. We only intend to provide our services in the United States. Public data Content visible to any other user on the Citizen platform is considered public data (for example, publicly posted comments and videos). You have control over public data on Citizen tied to your account, and can delete comments and videos you have posted. You can also delete your account from the app or email support@citizen.com to request to delete your account.

We retain the information in order to provide and maintain the quality of the Services you have requested, or if we are obliged to retain such information for legal, regulatory, fraud prevention, accounting, or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use and/or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

We are not concerned with an analysis of identifiable individuals, and we take steps to ensure that your rights and the legitimacy of our activities are ensured through the use of aggregated or otherwise de-identified data.

    "text": "Privacy Policy We are “Red Black Tree d.o.o. Čačak“, reg.no. 20857706, a software development company registered at and operating under the laws and legislation of the Republic of Serbia. This privacy policy will explain how our organization uses the personal data we collect from you when you use our website (“Site”), or when you communicate with us using Internet, or by other means of communication. Red Black Tree accepts and follows local and international standards and rules regarding personal data collection via it’s corporate website (Site), therefore this Privacy Policy is established to provide you with information on which personal data we are collecting and how, for which purposes, and other details in this regard, and applies to your personal data whichever country you are coming from. We as a company are legally bound to comply with the jurisdiction of the Republic of Serbia, which has accepted and incorporated EU’s GDPR into it’s legislation, and therefore the actual EU regulation (GDPR). Primarily, your personal data collected via Red Black Tree corporate website are protected under the Law on Personal Data Protection of the Republic of Serbia, which is in harmony with EU’s GDPR (The Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia, number 97/08). Pursuantly, Red Black Tree and this Privacy Policy follows the personal data definition under General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union (GDPR): Personal data are any information which are related to an identified or identifiable natural person (Art. 4.1 of GDPR), i.e. any information that can identify an individual, either directly or when combined with other data. However, we strive to maintain protection of personal data which is also compliant on most territories of North America (that is, USA and Canada) and United Kingdom. We believe that personal data protection established by instruments of GDPR should also suffice, at least in key-elements, when most other worldly legislations are concerned. There are quite a few internationally accepted and valid definitions of “personal data”, although most of them share the same principal elements. For instance, the Personal Identification Data, as described in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. The data subjects are identifiable if they can be directly or indirectly identified, especially by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or one of several special characteristics, which expresses the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, commercial, cultural or social identity of these natural persons. In practice, these also include all data which are or can be assigned to a person in any kind of way. For example, the telephone, credit card or personnel number of a person, account data, number plate, appearance, customer number or address are all personal data, also commonly known as personal identifying data, or elsewhere as personal identifying information. Particularly sensitive information such as health information, income, religion and cultural profiles and the like is also personal data (RBT is not collecting them). Furthermore, and crucial in the present context, data on user behavior is also personal. Cookies can track and register individual users’ browsing activities, like what articles they scroll past and which ones they choose to click on. In this regard, we are assuring you that our core-business is not based upon, dependent upon or focused on collection of any personal data. We strive to run our business, which is mostly software development, without collection and usage of your personal data. Therefore, we may get in touch with, or in possession of, your personal data primarily while you are visiting our Site, or while you are communicating with us using email, either as a representative of our current or prospective clients, business partners or other parties interested in our software development business. This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their Personal Data, or Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is being used online when accessing our corporate website, whichever jurisdiction they are coming from as visitors of our Site, or while communicating with us using email.

All requests can be submitted via info@c2ccertified.org and will be taken care of within reasonable time. Your request will be followed up, except when C2CPII has a legitimate reason not to do so (for example when the processing is legitimate and/or C2CPII has a legitimate interest in processing the data, like when the personal data is needed to comply with obligations by contract or law or for a legal action).

Whether during or after a transaction your private credit card information will not be stored on our servers. However, no system or information can ever be fully protected against every possible hazard. As a result, we cannot assure or warrant the security or privacy of any information you provide to us and, accordingly, you do so at your own risk.

We encourage interested persons to share any concerns with us and we will investigate and attempt to resolve any complaints and disputes regarding the use or disclosure of your information. If a complaint or dispute cannot be resolved through our internal processes, then we agree to dispute resolution through a third party resolution provider such as the Council of Better Business Bureaus (BBB), TRUSTe, or Direct Marketing Assoc., that also incorporate the Safe Harbor Framework.

    "text": "BYOND Privacy Policy BYOND is more than a gaming engine: It is a community of game developers and players, and we want to provide a safe space for people to participate. A large part of that is protecting your privacy. We created this document to explain, in as few words possible, the information we collect and how we use it to better your experience here on BYOND. If you have any questions about the policy, feel free to contact us! BYOND Accounts Registration with BYOND requires you to input the following pieces of information: Account name We recommend that you choose an account name unrelated to your real name, as this identifier cannot be changed without deleting the account. Password Your password is not visible or known to BYOND Staff, as it passed through a one-way encryption (or a hash) before being stored in the database. Gender This is strictly used to set the appropriate pronoun when your avatar is used in any games you may play. It needn't correspond to your in real life gender and is not, therefore, personally identifying information. Email address This is used to validate your account at signup, and for account recovery. This address will not be shared, either within the BYOND community or with outside parties, except as described in the Protection of your information section below. We may contact you at this address to provide alerts to game or community activity; however, you may opt-out of this behavior by visiting your Account Settings. You may modify any of the above information (outside of the account name), access more optional settings, or deactivate your BYOND Account at any time by visiting your Account Settings. Account deactivation hides your public profile (which displays your account name, gender, game and developer creations, favorite games and resources, and any other information you have chosen to share with the community). It also clears your password from the database. Forum posts are not deleted, although you may contact us for assistance with that (or anything else!) Purchases Purchase of a BYOND Membership or any other services on the website may require the input of personal information, such as your real name, mailing address, and credit-card information. All of this information is processed securely and off-site by third-party providers (currently PayPal and Stripe). We do not store any of this information and have very limited access to it, only as provided by the aforementioned third-parties. For some purchases we may ask you to confirm if you are a resident of New York state. This is for tax purposes only and is not shared. Site and software usage When you login to the website or use the software client, our servers will create a log entry including your account name, your IP address, and the game you are playing (if applicable). This information is used to enforce the Terms of Service; specifically, to block violating users from spamming the network or website through multiple accounts or IP-addresses. As BYOND does not store personal information about its users (such as real name or address), this practice only correlates anonymous accounts. When you use the software client, our servers will also collect an additional piece of information known as a hardware-ID. This is a unique numerical value for your computer that has no meaning outside of BYOND. As with the IP address, its sole purpose is to correlate accounts (users playing BYOND games from the same computer) who are known to be violating the TOS. Games hosted via the BYOND software have access to this same IP-address and (when applicable) hardware-ID information of any users who connect to them. They may also transparently query our servers to block correlated accounts. We have no control or jurisdiction over games hosted with the software and their individual policies. Game information is collected for the following purposes: Getting an accurate count of the total number of players online each day. Getting accurate stats about how many unique players play each game and for how long. Displaying a user's current or recent games-played activity to their friends or to the general public, depending on their privacy preferences. The information listed in this section is never shared with third parties, except for the limited cases described in Protection of your information below. Information about which games a particular account has played is stored only for a limited period (currently, about 2 weeks). Login information may be stored for a longer term, and is used for purposes of maintaining the ban system and account recovery. Analytics As with most hosted sites, our server's access logs contain technical information about your website visits. This includes, but is not limited to, your browser, operating system, and IP address. Aside from the information outlined in the Site and software usage, we do not correlate this data with your account. The BYOND website makes use of Google Analytics in order to collect traffic statistics about the userbase. This includes (but may not be limited to) the IP address and geographic location. This data is only accessible to us in an aggregate view, and contains no personal identifying information about you. Cookies The BYOND website uses cookies to store temporary user information, primarily to prevent the need to repeatedly enter login credentials to use the site. Advertisement We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the site or use the associated software. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements. We do not have access to, nor control over, these third parties' data collection practices and we do not assume any liability related to their collection or use. User-generated content All of the forums on BYOND should be treated as public, and as such, you should avoid the posting of any personal information. You are free to edit or delete any posts you have made. You may send a message to a moderator or contact us if you feel your privacy is violated in any way on the forums or elsewhere. You may send messages to other BYOND users through the software client or the website. These messages are stored in the database for a short time (approximately a week) and then automatically deleted. Only you, the recipient, and BYOND Staff have access to these messages, and BYOND Staff will only review them if alerted, in order to enforce the the Terms of Service. Correlated Accounts BYOND moderators may be able to access limited information regarding logins, for the purposes of determining if two accounts belong to the same person. The BYOND hub may also report to game servers if a user matches another person on their ban list. The suspicion or likelihood that two or more accounts belong to the same person is not regarded, broadly speaking, as private information, because of the impact such a correlation has on hosting games and on website administration. The fact of a correlation may be disclosed at the discretion of BYOND staff. Typically, this is mostly when a Terms of Service violation or habitual violator is involved. Protection of your information Aside from the cases mentioned above, BYOND will never disclose any information we collect about you, except: as designated by applicable law; e.g., if we are issued a court order. for technical reasons; eg, if we are moved to new ownership or otherwise need to transfer our data. to protect our network, website, or individual users as per the Terms of Service; practically speaking, this may for example mean (but is not limited to) filing a report with a user's ISP and/or the relevant authorities. Any third-party advertising or traffic measurement services used by BYOND are individually responsible for whatever limited information they may collect (e.g., your IP address, or cookies created by these services), subject to their respective privacy policies. BYOND does not share your personal information with these third parties. Regarding payment processing, all information used in transactions is collected and handled by the payment processor themselves, not by BYOND. We do not collect or store this information, although we may choose to store non-identifying transaction tokens that may be used to look up transactions via the payment provider. Privacy policy changes We may update this policy from time to time as we introduce new features or modify existing ones. We encourage you to review this document periodically.

While processing Personal Data We take into due account the risk involved in the processing and the nature of the Personal Data. While we implement safeguards designed to protect your information, We cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others. We cannot and do not guarantee or warrant the security of your Personal Data or any information you disclose or transmit to us. We are not responsible for the acts of those who gain unauthorized access, and We make no warranty, express, implied or otherwise, that We will prevent such access, and We are not responsible for any damages or liabilities relating to any such incidents to the fullest extent permitted by law.

When We retain information for the improvement and development of our Engagements or new products/features, We take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and We only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our Engagements, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about you. Legal stuff made easy We work hard to make sure your personal information is kept safe and accurate. We use various methods to protect your data from being lost, misused, or accessed without permission. Even though We have protections in place, we can't guarantee total safety, especially online, from intrusion by others and We can't promise your data is 100% invincible.

This is why you should also take standard precautions protecting your data, your credentials and access to the Account. We'll notify you of significant data breaches as required. We only keep the information that's needed for its original purpose, what you've allowed us to use it for, or what the law or our Agreement with you permits. We won't hold onto it any longer than necessary, unless there are legal or contract reasons to do so. When We use your data to improve our Services or develop new ones, we remove any details that can directly identify you. We focus on general trends, not individual details about you. Speaking about retention, We keep data only as needed, following your authorization or legal requirements. 6.

    "text": "Privacy Policy Privacy Notice The International Society for Research on Internet Interventions (ISRII) is committed to protecting the privacy of all members and guests who visit the ISRII website. This policy was developed in the interest of protecting that privacy. This policy applies only to ISRII’s website, www.isrii.org. It does not apply to the websites of any member or liaison organization. It does not apply to any websites operated by organizations or groups who associate themselves with ISRII, nor does it apply to any websites featuring links to the ISRII website. Our privacy policy does not apply to the practices of organizations or persons not owned, controlled, managed or employed by ISRII. This policy will be periodically reexamined as technology, business and legal requirements change. Collection of Information When you browse ISRII’s website as a guest, you are anonymous. ISRII does not collect personal information about any person that is not provided voluntarily. We track anonymous information, such as which pages were visited and for how long, on our server. We use this information solely to learn more about trends on the website, such as which web pages users visit most and how quickly information is found. If you apply for membership, register for an event or request any other product or service, ISRII collects information from you such as your name, title, company, address, phone, fax and email address. This information is collected only if you give it voluntarily. Information provided to ISRII will be used internally in order to process your specific request and will not be sold or shared with outside parties. Your information may be used to send you ISRII publications, information relating to upcoming ISRII activities or important membership announcements. In addition, ISRII makes members’ contact information available to other members through the members-only portion of the website. This information can only be accessed with a legitimate ISRII username and password; for this reason, we strongly urge you limit unauthorized access to your ISRII username and password. You may edit your contact information at any time through the members-only portion of the website or by calling or emailing ISRII Headquarters at +1 720.724.7744 or info@isrii.org. Disclosure of Information ISRII may occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as bulk mailing or publication printing. We provide those companies only with the information they need to complete to service they have been contracted to perform, and they are prohibited from using the information provided for any other purpose. ISRII may disclose your information if we are required to do so by law or if such disclosure is necessary to: comply with a legal order; defend ISRII or its employees, affiliates or partners; or protect the personal safety of ISRII employees, affiliates, partners, members or site users. Credit Card Information You may choose to provide ISRII with credit card information to pay for membership dues, event fees or any other product or service. We will never voluntarily disclose your credit card information to any third-party organization or person who is not employed by ISRII to process your payment. _We urge members and all other end users not to send credit card information via e-mail, instant messaging or social media, because these methods are not secure and could cause the data to be compromised. _ Cookies Cookies are commonly used by websites in order to make accessing that website faster and more efficient. Many organizations use cookies to track your shopping cart, for example, so that you can purchase several items or services at one time instead of having to purchase each item at the time you select it. ISRII uses cookies to monitor statistics regarding your visit to the website (such as how long you visited, what web pages you visited on our site, etc.) and to hold items in your shopping cart for you. We use “session-only” cookies, which are deleted from your computer’s memory when you close your browser window. You can set your internet browser to not accept cookies, or to ask you before accepting certain types of cookies, but this may keep you from having access to all of the benefits of the ISRII website. Using cookies in this manner is standard across the majority of all websites. Security ISRII has taken measures to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of information on this website. We have the technology in place to provide a secure server for transmission of data to and from our website. All information (including your address and credit card information) is encrypted when sent through our secure server so that no other party can access it. Disclaimers: Any material published on the ISRII website is protected by International Intellectual Property and Copyright laws. All text, logos, graphics, icons, photographs, software and audiovisual material fall under this protection. Permission is granted to download, copy or print material on ISRII’s website for personal, instructional or non-commercial use only.

    "text": "Luanti Forums - Privacy policy This policy explains in detail how “Luanti Forums” along with its affiliated companies (hereinafter “we”, “us”, “our”, “Luanti Forums”, “https://forum.luanti.org”) and phpBB (hereinafter “they”, “them”, “their”, “phpBB software”, “www.phpbb.com”, “phpBB Limited”, “phpBB Teams”) use any information collected during any session of usage by you (hereinafter “your information”). Your information is collected via two ways. Firstly, by browsing “Luanti Forums” will cause the phpBB software to create a number of cookies, which are small text files that are downloaded on to your computer’s web browser temporary files. The first two cookies just contain a user identifier (hereinafter “user-id”) and an anonymous session identifier (hereinafter “session-id”), automatically assigned to you by the phpBB software. A third cookie will be created once you have browsed topics within “Luanti Forums” and is used to store which topics have been read, thereby improving your user experience. We may also create cookies external to the phpBB software whilst browsing “Luanti Forums”, though these are outside the scope of this document which is intended to only cover the pages created by the phpBB software. The second way in which we collect your information is by what you submit to us. This can be, and is not limited to: posting as an anonymous user (hereinafter “anonymous posts”), registering on “Luanti Forums” (hereinafter “your account”) and posts submitted by you after registration and whilst logged in (hereinafter “your posts”). Your account will at a bare minimum contain a uniquely identifiable name (hereinafter “your user name”), a personal password used for logging into your account (hereinafter “your password”) and a personal, valid email address (hereinafter “your email”). Your information for your account at “Luanti Forums” is protected by data-protection laws applicable in the country that hosts us. Any information beyond your user name, your password, and your email address required by “Luanti Forums” during the registration process is either mandatory or optional, at the discretion of “Luanti Forums”. In all cases, you have the option of what information in your account is publicly displayed. Furthermore, within your account, you have the option to opt-in or opt-out of automatically generated emails from the phpBB software. Your password is ciphered (a one-way hash) so that it is secure. However, it is recommended that you do not reuse the same password across a number of different websites. Your password is the means of accessing your account at “Luanti Forums”, so please guard it carefully and under no circumstance will anyone affiliated with “Luanti Forums”, phpBB or another 3rd party, legitimately ask you for your password. Should you forget your password for your account, you can use the “I forgot my password” feature provided by the phpBB software. This process will ask you to submit your user name and your email, then the phpBB software will generate a new password to reclaim your account. "

    "text": "W3C privacy policy Read this page in: 中文（简体） 日本語 Page contents Public web browsing (non-logged-in) Logged-in usage Mailing lists Law enforcement and other compelled disclosures Changes from the previous version of the policy Status: This policy was enacted on 24 March 2014, and is in effect since 5 August 2014. Public web browsing (non-logged-in) We make no effort to identify public users of our site. No identifying data is disclosed to any third party for any purpose. Data that we collect is used only for server administration, site improvement, usage statistics, and Web protocol research. We log HTTP requests to our site including 'IP', 'Referer' and 'User-Agent' to be able to analyze the traffic. We use cookies for purposes including to understand usage patterns of the site and to maintain session state for some applications. Pages may link to or embed content such as video from other sites. Those resources are governed by the privacy policies of their originating sites. Logged information may be kept indefinitely as administrative, diagnostic, and research material, or discarded for any reason. Such information is not disclosed outside of host site personnel. Aggregate (non-identifying) statistics generated from these logs may be reported publicly as part of research results. If you set the Do-Not-Track header, which is an option in the preferences of many browsers, we will treat you just like all our other users, because we do not track any users for behavioral targeting. Note: We intend to update our practices as necessary to follow subsequent W3C privacy recommendations. Logged-in usage When you create a user account, you are asked for a username, email address, real name, and affiliation. This information is stored in the database and displayed on your public profile page; your email address is not displayed in your profile unless you choose to do so. You may choose to provide additional information for public display. We use some of this information to show organizational affiliations and participant activity including group membership, mailing list and conference call contributions, and editorship credits. This record of activity is important to organizational transparency in our Process and Patent Policy. Mailing lists Mailing lists associated with W3C are publicly archived. On your first submission to one of these lists, you will be asked to approve the public posting of your message. We do not remove postings from archived lists per our archive-editing policy. Law enforcement and other compelled disclosures In the event that we are required by law (including a court order) to disclose the information you submit, we will make an effort to provide you with notice (unless we are prohibited) that a request for your information has been made and give you an opportunity to object to the disclosure. We will attempt to provide this notice by email, if you have given us an email address. We will independently object to over-broad requests for access to information about users of our site. If you do not challenge the disclosure request we may be legally required to turn over information. Changes from the previous version of the policy The policy has been clarified to reflect current technology and W3C practices. We do not intend material changes in what W3C does with information resulting from visits to our site. The changes from the previous version are: The distinction between Member and non-Member browsing was not a useful distinction in practice. The new policy is much clearer about behavior when users are logged in or not logged in. W3C uses a number of open source tools that use cookies to maintain state, such as WordPress, Media Wiki, and Bugzilla. The policy has been updated to make it clearer that we may use cookies for state management and to understand usage patterns in order to improve our site. W3C will continue to not track people for behavioral targeting; we mention this with reference to DNT signals. The policy is clearer about how W3C account data is managed. We dropped mention of some practices that W3C has discontinued (e.g., automatic newsletter subscription)."

Each browser You use will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options in this regard. Please be aware that if You disable or remove these tracking technologies some parts of our Website may not work and when You revisit Our Website your ability to limit browser-based tracking technologies is subject to Your browser settings and limitations. Various third parties are developing or have developed signals or other mechanisms known as “do not track signals.” For instance, some browsers may have such signal options, although they differ as to if the signal is set as default or must be turned on by the user. Further, there is currently no standard as to what sites and app operators should do with regard to these signals. Currently, we do not monitor or take any action with respect to these signals or other mechanisms, although we may consider doing so if an understandable and practical standard is developed and widely adopted.
